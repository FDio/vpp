Though as long as you\u0027re happy I\u0027ll also remove OUTPUT_QUIET as it\u0027s useful to see what the call to setup.py is actually doing.",

      "message": "Previously with OUTPUT_QUIET there was literally no outputed indication that anything had been installed, as it was completely suppressed. By removing OUTPUT_QUIET the custom execute_process command output is plumbed into cmakes standard pipes and controlled from there. I assume that standard output control will apply.\n\nFrom the cmake docs:\n\u0027If no OUTPUT_* or ERROR_* options are given the output will be shared with the corresponding pipes of the CMake process itself.\u0027\n\nHowever if it\u0027s truly desired that this installation is performed silently, I\u0027m happy to put the OUTPUT_QUIET back. I care mostly about the other changes that actually integrate this python install with the system.",
