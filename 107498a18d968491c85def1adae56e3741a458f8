You probably should separate them in different gerrit patches, espacially given that they are very loosely coupled (if at all)\n- Wrt raw IP packet support, the \"guessing\" method is fun, but I wonder if we couldn\u0027t have a more \"structured\" approach here (where basically we know in advance upon calling the trace filter function if it is L2 or L3...) Thoughts about why this would be impossible?",
