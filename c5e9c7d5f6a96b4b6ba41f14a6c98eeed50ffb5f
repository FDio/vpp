      "message": "Fragmentation should deal with that problem before tcp/udp, which should never be exposed to fragments. \n\nThe point is that we shouldn\u0027t be doing handoffs all over the place as they\u0027re not cheap. Typically, lower layers should handle consistent thread selection for a flow otherwise all features would have to reimplement their own handoff on their own.",

      "message": "Currently the fragment udp packets is reassembled in it\u0027s own node like: ip4-full-reassembly. But if the nic rss do not support ipv4-frag and is configured with ipv4-udp and ipv4 rss, nic will treat all fragment udp packets as ipv4 packet not udp packet, and will RSS the reassembled udp packet to different thread, this will lead to session layer error. So in our project, I have to turn off ipv4-udp. Now I think just handoff the packet to right thread, can solve the problem.",
