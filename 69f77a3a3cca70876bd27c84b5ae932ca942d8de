The handler starts on the line 916 below, and it calls the function here. So I think this is a copy-paste remnant from the old handler. Could you take a look and confirm you agree this is indeed the case ?",

      "message": "Filter is passed as a u8 in this function, so I wonder if it ever worked. We can still call clib_net_to_host_u32() in vl_api_one_eid_table_dump_t_handler when calling send_one_eid_table_details and actually fix api_one_eid_table_dump by setting mp-\u003efilter \u003d clib_host_to_net_u32 (filter)\n\n@Onong could you take a look at it?\n\nEdit: my reply overlapped with Andrew\u0027s. Agreed!",
