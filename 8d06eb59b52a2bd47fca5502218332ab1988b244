I think that is because there are 6 common fields, 3 L2, 4 L3, and 3 L4 so common + L2 -\u003e 9 and common + L2 + L3 + L4 -\u003e 16. Am I understanding that right?\n\nIf so, I think it might be easier to understand what those values mean if you declare numeric constants like common_fields \u003d 6, l2_fields \u003d 3, etc. And then instead of passing 9 as an argument to the verify function, you could pass common_fields + l2_fields.",

I will change them to constants.",
