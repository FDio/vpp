This is a simple shell script to run VPP build inside a Docker container.
Very useful for all kinds of CI systems, or in general when there is a need
to build VPP for a target different from the build machine.

Currently three targets (build containers) are supported:
Ubuntu 16.04
Ubuntu 14.04
CentOS 7

It should be easy to add a new build container type by adding a Dockerfile.<OS>
in this (build-root/docker) directory.

The only requirement on the build machine is to have ‘docker’ installed and
the user with the permissions to use it.

Follow the official Docker documentation:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/
TL;TR
# curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh

Examples:

Quick build for Ubuntu 14.04:
# build-root/docker/runc.sh ubuntu:14.04 build-root/vagrant/build.sh

Build RPM packages on non-RPM based host (e.g. on Ubuntu 16.10):
# build-root/docker/runc.sh centos:7 make bootstrap pkg-rpm

Run make test on the host without Python run-time:
# build-root/docker/runc.sh ubuntu:16.04 make bootstrap test
