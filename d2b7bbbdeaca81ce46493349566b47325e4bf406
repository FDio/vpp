We should move to a solution to determine a cache line size such that even cloud VPP binary works seamlessly on all Aarch64 targets or we create two cloud binaries for ARM\n\nAlso semantically, any junk value to TARGET_PLATFORM is valid i.e. \n\nmake build-release TARGET_PLATFORM\u003dfoo \n\nis also valid command",
