      "message": "@Damjan,\n\nGiven current valid VPP_PLATFORM options, there needs to be 10 additional u8\u0027s available in this string, so I added 16 to preserve alignment and provide some headroom.\n\nOf note, is the fact that the same #define is used to initialize \u0027os_dist_str\u0027 which has plenty of headroom [0].  The fact that VPP_BUILD_VER is used to initialize the os_dist_str seems to be incorrect IMHO.\n\nI do not have access to a test environment on AWS.  Can you please verify that this change does not cause issues for the plugin_ena driver?\n\n[0] https://github.com/FDio/vpp/blob/master/src/plugins/dev_ena/ena.c#L16",
