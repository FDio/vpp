      "message": "This looks good, just trying to compare this with the linux API.\n\nrs-\u003eack_time looks like the interval time for the sampling interval.  Could you rename it interval_time?\n\nCan you also include some additional fields in the rate sample structure: rtt_time, losses, acked_sacked and prior_in_flight.\n\n  - rtt_time : RTT of last (S)ACKed packet (or -1)\n    This is being measured on the ack path in tcp_update_rtt - can it be added to the rate sample\n\n  - losses - freshly marked lost \n  - acked_sacked - freshly ACKed or SACKed\n  - prior_in_flight - packets in flight at the time of the Ack received\n\n\nThere was a check in the linux implementation for when the interval time is less than the min_rtt on the connection.   I think this is worth including - but requires that the min_rtt is tracked on the connection.",
