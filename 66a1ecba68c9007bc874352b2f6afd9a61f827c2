      "message": "The intention of ip_input_acl is not to classify packets starting from the IP header; it is to classify from start of packet in the IP4 or IP6 forwarding path (invoked via the ip4/6-input node). Thus, it is reasonable to classify the L2 header in the IP forwarding path as well. This also means matching is expected to be 16-byte aligned since it is from start of packet, as least for the DPDK-input case. If one wants to classify from IP header only, he can certainly skip from start of the packet in 16B units but making sure to match the precise offset of the start of IP header, depending on existence of VLAN tags or tunnel header, etc. So, this change is not appropriate (unless we really want to change the semantics of what ip_input_acl is doing). I think it is appropriate to add a comment here to say h0 is L2 header to avoid future confusion.",

      "message": "ip_input_acl node is the generic input ACL node for L3 interfaces, invoked from ip-input node for all IP packets.  l2_input_acl is invoked from l2-input node for L2 interfaces only. I agree the name may be misleading but the flexibility to match L2 header for L3 interfaces is required. As for assuming -\u003edata to be L2 header, it is true only for \"normal\" interfaces and not tunnels or other virtual interfaces. So I do agree we should correct this by keeping l2_len in vlib_buffer for all interfaces types, not just for L2 interfaces, etc. This will need a more generic clean-up effort of the VPP code base though as there are many code paths with this assumption.",
