My experience of what Bash does in this case never aligns with what I want it to do, for example. :)\n\nThat said, if the cursor is at the end of a word, under whitespace, then the behavior should be straightforward - do completion as usual, with the catch that you need to preserve the rest of the line, and your relative cursor position in it.",
