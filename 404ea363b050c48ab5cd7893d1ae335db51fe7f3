They require this for their application which is based on VPP and they need to be able to perform VLAN hardware offloads consistently across their deployments.",

Without digging through the code, it would be nice to have a sentence or two explaining \"when \u0027program_vlans\u0027 is set to 0, [this happens, or something else cannot happen]. By setting it to 1, [something else happens, or something else doesn\u0027t happen] the latter is the desired behavior.\"",
