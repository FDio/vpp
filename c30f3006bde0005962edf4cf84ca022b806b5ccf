      "message": "The kernel keeps track of counter overflows within mmap_page-\u003eoffset, so you need to add to _rdpmc value to get a correct value if the counter has overflowed.\n\nSee this commit from Beno√Æt: https://gerrit.fd.io/r/c/vpp/+/33380 + comments above lines 34-40.\n\nHas this not been undone here? It looks like we\u0027re just taking the values straight from _rdpmc again.",

      "message": "So after some investigation and discussion - we concluded that this was the least worst option. \n\nBenoit\u0027s patch was essentially inserting one lock for each counter read before _and_ after each graph node. And that was having a very noticeable performance impact, and negating any positive performance advantage a userspace rdpmc was having. \n\nSo it became a trade off of ignoring the offset value versus continually locking.",
