      "message": "Hello Matthew,\n\nSorry for breaking OSPF with my latest LCP patch. This time I tried my best to improve the lifetime of LCP objects (both routes and tables) with my last 3 LCP patches.\n\nI also checked that OSPF works just fine with those 3. I actually wanted to cover it with unit tests but it seems like we run tests in unprivileged mode, any idea how to implement a proper test with that limitation?\nI want to cover the OSPF case, so we don\u0027t break it anymore.\n\nPlease let me know what you think of this patchset.\n\nThanks!",
