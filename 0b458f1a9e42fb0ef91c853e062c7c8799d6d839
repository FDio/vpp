      "message": "\"2*timeout\" or \"2+timeout\" here does not affect the overall run time (in the success case) because the successful test should complete after \"timeout\" - trivial to see this by editing the timeout value in framework.py to be 45 seconds and doing \"time TEST\u003dtest_cli make test-debug\"\n\nThus after having seen and fixed in the past hew months a fair few \"off-by-a-second, breaks only once in a blue moon, and only on parallel runs, and only with many enough workers\" tricky to reproduce test failures I strongly believe the \"2*timeout\" is a better choice here.",

Feel free to submit a *separate* change to reduce it down to 10 if you feel like saving a bit... It\u0027s not the most long running tests, so up to you...
