      "message": "We *could* set fib_index_by_sw_if_index[idx] to 0, but we don\u0027t really care as we are deleting the interface. \nThis would make the logic a bit more complex as other calls rely on that information (e.g. ip4_mfib_interface_enable_disable). So we would have to ensure ip_table_bind(0) is always called last.\nAlso this would trigger the table_bind_callbacks on interface delete \nwhich might not be what we want here.",
