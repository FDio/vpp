      "message": "1. I think it\u0027s necessary to refuse to remove the table as long as table is used by any other subsystem. So should I take into account all the subsystems using the classifier table at this patch?\n2. At patchset 1, I used refcount. But shortly afterwards, I changed to use bitmaps, which can indicate it is referenced by which interfaces. I am not sure if it\u0027s necessary to use bitmaps because I think bitmaps is not complex, hope to get any further ideas.",
