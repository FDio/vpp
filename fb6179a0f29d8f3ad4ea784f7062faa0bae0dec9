We could show them there with an additional field `fast path: yes` or something like that. Some changes in `vnet/ipsec/ipsec_cli.c` would be needed for that.",

I think this is missing allowance for collisions.\n\nI don\u0027t know what a \"generous allowance\" is - seems for some other 16_8 bihash in code they are using num_buckets * 1024.\n\nIf my calculation is correct sizeof (clib_bihash_kv_16_8_t) \u003d 196 * BIHASH_KVP_PER_PAGE \u003d 784, so bumping this to 1024 seems reasonable to me.\n\n1: https://fdio-vpp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted/developers/bihash.html#initializing-a-bihash-table",
