      "message": "Hello Alexander,\n\nSorry for the late reply, I was away from my computer for some time.\n\nNo, that function  won\u0027t help to cleanup v6 routes. Also, it handles only the interface\u0027s fib while you can install routes from other VRFs via that interfaces.\n\nThe reason for my patch is an ultimate routes removal whenever we disable LCP and/or remove the interface. We run vpp in a very dynamic environment with a lot of containers being spawn and removed. The main culprit is the lifetime of LCP objects that I tried to address in my last 3 LCP patches.",
