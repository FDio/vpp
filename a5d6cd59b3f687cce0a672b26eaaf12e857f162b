      "message": "Unfortunately, this patch does not solve the issue I am seeing.\nThese three values are still 0.  When the MACIP ACL is initially created,\nthese values are 3 and there is a chain of classifier tables from 0 to 3\nand last_table finalizes at 3.\n\nWhen the ACL is reapplied, the classifier table is still there as 0 to 3, but the value of last_table counts _down_ to 0.\n\nI suspect the a-\u003e{ip4,ip6,l2}_table_index values all need to be 0 or else all need to be 3 in both the initial create and later replace cases.\n\nI sent email to the list detailing this a bit more.",
