      "message": "A narrative ? Hum. Well.\nOnce upon a time, a session-less l2tp packet arrived to l2tp-decap node. It visited stage1 function, got looked-up by a beardy dark haired switch at line 83 which told him: \"Thou have no session ! Thou shall not pass\". And he stamped him at line 99 with a blue all-caps mystic symbol: L2T_DECAP_NEXT_NO_INTERCEPT right in his l2t.next_index meta-data field. Poor pal...\nWhen the packet later visited last_stage, it was still wearing that demonic mark, and got therefore rightfully dropped. And he died later on in vlib_buffer_free.",
