      "message": "I once consider to use vcl option as well, but considering support LD_PRELOAD, I think it is not good to make vcl have too many interface, so I prefer that we can keep this option in vpp configuration instead of vcl configuration to make VCL transparent. How do you think so? \nSo the first patch is to enable TLS support in VCL first, and then the second can add an option to let user to choose openssl or mbedtls.",

      "message": "No need to add a new api. We already have the “APP_OPTIONS_TLS_ENGINE” attach option. Just add it to vcl’s attach message with value openssl. That way vcl will end up openssl dependent, but other apps will be able to request something else.\n \nAlso, as we go forward we may end up with multiple TLS engines in vpp, so depending on the environment applications may really want to ask for a specific engine. I don’t like having that many options either, but we may end up at one point exposing such apis to applications …",
