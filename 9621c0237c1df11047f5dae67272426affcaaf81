      "message": "Hello guys,\nThis patch fixes broken nat-t scnerio, where 2 flows udp/500 and udp/4500 are received from different queues (and go to different workers as well).\nHowever, I decided not to memorize ike sa (e.g. by creating hash table worker_by_rspi) and hand it over to the corresponding worker rather than handing everything over to the main thread.\nIt will open a window for a couple of simplifications (I can include them to this patch or to the next one). Also, I don\u0027t think we really need MT enabled plugin as dataplane for ipsec is already processed by multiple workers w/o issues.\nWhat do you think?",
