We should probably flag gso packets in the session layer once they\u0027re created and here we should just check the flag. \n\nThat is a bit involved. In the meantime, just ensure that you either generate packets less than 1.5kB or larger than 2kB in tcp_session_cal_goal_size. That way you won\u0027t need to gso one buffer packets.",
