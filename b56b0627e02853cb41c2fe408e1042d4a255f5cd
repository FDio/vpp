Thus my question is why does it exist at all?\n\nI agree that if it is required, then the existing code is broken, but I don\u0027t understand where the requirement for the else statement comes from.  It would appear this comes from a build that is outside of the git tree, which is I believe is an unsupported use-case as far as this Makefile is concerned (per another email thread on vpp-dev@lists.fd.io).",
