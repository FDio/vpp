      "message": "Hi Alexander,\n\nI think it would be better to avoid having the uninitialized bytes in the first place.\n\nIt seems like this probably arises from the fact that in lcp_router_route_mk_prefix(), ip46_address_reset() is called for FIB_PROTOCOL_IP4 but not for FIB_PROTOCOL_IP6. Prior to support for MPLS being added a few months ago, it would have been called for both address families.\n\nCan you call ip46_address_reset() for FIB_PROTOCOL_IP6 in lcp_router_route_mk_prefix() to eliminate the possibility of uninitialized data?\n\nThanks,\n-Matt",
