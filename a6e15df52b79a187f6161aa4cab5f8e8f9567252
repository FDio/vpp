      "message": "Hi Neale,\n\nI didn\u0027t declare ports to have type dhcp_port_reg_t because it is possible to pass in the two values OR\u0027d together. I thought it might be confusing and appear that you are supposed to choose only one of the values if ports was declared as a dhcp_port_reg_t. I also didn\u0027t know if coverity might alert on the call in dhcp4_proxy_node.c which passes in DHCP_PORT_REG_CLIENT | DHCP_PORT_REG_SERVER.\n\nThat said, I can do whatever you think is best here. If it\u0027s a problem that I defined an enum type and did not use it, I can set the ports parameter to that type, or I could remove the typedef and just declare an anonymous enum containing DHCP_PORT_REG_*, or I could define DHCP_PORT_REG_* as preprocessor macros.\n\nLet me know which approach you think would be best and I can submit an updated patch.\n\nThanks for your review!\n-Matt",
