In the four months since launching, FD.io has brought together more than 75
developers from 11 different companies including network operators, solution
providers chip vendors, and network equipment vendors who are collaborating to
enhance and innovate around the Vector Packet Processing (VPP) technology. The
FD.io community has quickly formed to grow the number of projects from the
initial VPP project to an additional 6 projects addressing a diverse set of
requirements and usability across a variety of deployment environments.

The 16.06 release brings unprecedented performance: 480Gbps/200mpps with 8
million routes and 2k whitelist entries on standard high volume x86 servers.
