      "message": "FWIW, We use this to test something different from dual/quad loop code. Our case is testing packet re-ordering. We need to test multiple trips through a node where previous trips through have buffered packets for re-ordering (e.g. missing earlier packets). We actually need multiple frames to do this (we provide packet data that has mis-ordered IP packets in it). In our case the re-ordering code is implemented using a window size (rather than just a timer). So we test the combination of ways packets can be reordered in (or just outside) this window as well as the packets arriving in different \"clumps\" based on the \"maxframe\" size.",
