That is, there\u0027s no more data to be enqueued into fifo.\n\nAlso, if there\u0027s no data in quicly, remind me, what happens if transport is deleted? Session, and fifos, in theory should not be deleted until app confirms close.",

Since session doesn\u0027t migrate to closing state on half-close it shouldn\u0027t be cleaned up until rx is also closed. \n\nLet\u0027s talk Monday :)",
