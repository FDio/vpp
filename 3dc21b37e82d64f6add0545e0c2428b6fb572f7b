Therefore it would be better to append \"-FAILED\" to the symlink name so that it is obvious that these are the output of the failed unit tests.\n\nHere is an example of the build log directory:\n\nhttps://logs.fd.io/production/vex-yul-rot-jenkins-1/vpp-verify-master-ubuntu1604/6614/\n\nAlso, all of the files in the directory should be gzip\u0027d like the existing log files so that we\u0027re not pushing/storing uncompressed files to the log server.",
