So the feature is advanced in the template pass the first feature and then copied to all the buffers in the following rx_burst, right? This is really cool! \nI suppose one side effect compare with before is that, at end of all features, we will always get back to ethernet-input node and not the node determined by etype. This seems a good compromise especially we also get rid of per packet packet-trace check.",
