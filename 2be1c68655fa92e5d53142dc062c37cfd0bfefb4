      "message": "Should probably have a discussion about a sane way of doing this without treading on things. The heaviest user of this is \"IP\" so that would leave IIRC 4 bytes to spare.\nSo if we went with something like:\nstruct {\n   union {\n    struct plugin_metadata_hi2lo {\n      u32 plugin_metadata_5;\n      u32 plugin_metadata_4;\n      ... \n     u32 plugin_metadata_0;\n    }\n    u32 plugin_metadata[6];\n}\n\nThen it hints that you should start filling plugin_metadata_0, so that other plugins who want just a \"bit\" of metadata but want to preserve IP still can. \n\nNot sure if thats obfuscating things too much but we can always comment it very well explaining why.",
