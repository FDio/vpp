      "message": "When using OpenStack, I need to know precisely how many hugepages of what type VPP is going to use, so that (a) I can preallocate them and (b) I can stop OpenStack trying to give them to VMs, which always ends badly.  How do I determine this number?  (Is this documented somewhere, which is really the more important question; not that I know my way around the VPP codebase but there\u0027s no doc change I see in the patch)\n\nDoes this make the \u0027find hugepages to use\u0027 code faster?  On a large machine with many hugepages (hello again OpenStack) hugepage allocation with 2M pages is, at present, very slow, resulting in a long period with no forwarding when I upgrade or restart VPP.",
