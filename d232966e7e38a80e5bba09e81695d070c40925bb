      "message": "This method is in wrong place. BFDUDPSession class represents instances of UDP sessions. Having a set_tos() method for session class makes it seem like you can set TOS per session, while in reality it\u0027s global setting.\n\nAlso, having a plain wrapper one-liner doesn\u0027t make much sense to me. How is it better than simply calling vapi.bfd_udp_set_tos()? What value does it bring having the wrapper?\n\nI think removing this method and simply calling vapi method is clearer and less code.",
