      "message": "I think the error message could be tweaked slightly here. With the existing format string, the formatted text will end up looking like \"rte_eal_init returned -11 (Try again (-11))\". All of the other messages seem to be of the format \"rte_something failed: \u003cmore info\u003e\", which might be better here too. E.g. \"rte_eal_init failed: %U\" would be formatted as \"rte_eal_init failed: Try again (-11)\".\n\nNot really a deal breaker or anything, just a suggestion.",
