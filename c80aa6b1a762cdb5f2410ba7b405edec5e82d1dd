      "message": "Looking at the perf job results [0] I see some test cases are inconclusive, but some show regressions up to 5%. Comparing perfmon statistics [1] to [2], I see the newer ipsecmb version has more L2 misses.\nInterestingly, the parent is also faster than crypto_native plugin.\n\nI think users of stable/2310 will prefer the better performance using the older ipsecmb version. The newer ipsecmb version is already merged in master so its performance can be optimized for next release.\n\n[0] https://jenkins.fd.io/view/vpp/job/vpp-csit-verify-perf-master-ubuntu2204-x86_64-3n-icx/66/console\n[1] https://s3-logs.fd.io/vex-yul-rot-jenkins-1/vpp-csit-verify-perf-master-ubuntu2204-x86_64-3n-icx/66/csit_current/0/log.html.gz#s1-s1-s1-s1-s2-t4-k2-k13-k22-k10-k1-k1-k1-k12\n[2] https://s3-logs.fd.io/vex-yul-rot-jenkins-1/vpp-csit-verify-perf-master-ubuntu2204-x86_64-3n-icx/66/csit_parent/0/log.html.gz#s1-s1-s1-s1-s2-t4-k2-k13-k22-k10-k1-k1-k1-k12",
