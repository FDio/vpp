But in the case where create_bypass_for_fwd_worker() returns 0, create_bypass_for_fwd() was already called in create_bypass_for_fwd_worker().\nIt seems like create_bypass_for_fwd_worker() should not call create_bypass_for_fwd(). Or the conditions on the if/else here should be changed. E.g. -\n\nif (sm-\u003enum_workers \u003e 1)\n  {\n    /* either session created for current thread, or we should handoff */\n    if (create_bypass_for_fwd_worker (sm, b, ip, rx_fib_index, thread_index))\n      next \u003d NAT_NEXT_OUT2IN_ED_HANDOFF;\n  }\nelse\n  {\n    create_bypass_for_fwd (sm, b, ip, rx_fib_index, thread_index);\n  }",
