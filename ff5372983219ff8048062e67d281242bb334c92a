      "message": "I think VLIB_NODE_FN (ipsec4_input_node) is to handle IPsec traffic(Be it ESP,AH or ESP encapsulated UDP). \nNoticed that plane text TCP and ICMP packet being forwarded without SPD policy match, Where UDP being dropped. \nTo proof that , just modify traffic type from UDP to TCP , will see all test get fails with same policy rules. \nIn my further investigation I found that, https://gerrit.fd.io/r/c/vpp/+/38791/4/src/vnet/ipsec/ipsec_input.c#549  line 549 hit for UDP as well as ESP encapsulated UDP packet. Probably , there is mishandling in RFC 3948.",
