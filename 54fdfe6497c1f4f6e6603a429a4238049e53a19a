      "message": "Device tests passed and they already use PAPI (which is the only part of CSIT directly affected by .api.json content). That being said, if a change actually adds an API message with the new comment statement in it, device tests may fail (either immediately, or when CSIT tries to use the new message). I do not expect any such failure (not even a warning as with deprecated messages), but I will create a VPP change to verify that.",
