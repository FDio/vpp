But I wasn\u0027t looking for information, I was making suggestions on how to change your patch to make it better.  The response to a change review comment really should be \u0027I will change this\u0027 or \u0027I will not change this for reasons\u0027.\n\n1. It makes logical sense to put the answering message after the requesting message.  Why don\u0027t you do this?\n\n2. All the information about what you should expect to find in the responses - one message per queue, per interface, for all (? or perhaps certain types of?) interfaces - is information that helps programmers use your API.  Document it, in comments, in the file, where they will find it when they go looking. They will not find your responses to my change review comments.",
