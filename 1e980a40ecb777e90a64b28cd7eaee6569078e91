So I thought this is better location to call increase function. But I admit it is not a significant improvement. Could you suggest an example of better location to do that?",

That is, when we generate enqueue notifications, we can also do the fifo tuning. \n\nThat mechanism is much more efficient in that it uses preallocated vectors to track the sessions with enqueued data.",
