      "message": "Hello! Could you please take a look at the patch?\n\nIt introduces V2 API so ip6-nd options could be controlled pretty much direct and predictable way. Currently I just doubt about \u0027defaults\u0027 option which ignores all the other inputs and just sets all feature options to default values(but maybe it\u0027s okay), like is_no option was used.\n\nThanks!",
