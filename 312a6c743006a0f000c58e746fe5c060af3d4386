      "message": "This code will work most of the time. The ipv6 address ::dead:beef (or is it dead:beef::0?) will print as an ip4 address. Please look at is_ip6 and pass the indicated explicit address family argument to format_ip46_address.\n\nformat_ip46_address should never be used with IP46_TYPE_ANY, in fact we should remove it. It depends on pad byte values which are not a reliable address family indication.",
