      "message": "Burt, \nThanks for your comment. This ifdef is used elsewhere in the Makefile and although it looks awkward, it works. Although we only \"officially\" support Centos, the test will include Centos RHEL and Fedora.\nAlso, I wanted this to be a \"surgical\" fix to address the narrow issue of stopping the build when a new package is introduced into the deps.",

      "message": "Burt, thanks for your review and I think you have some good points. However, there are two conflicting things here. A development oriented build system and building for release have somewhat different needs.\nIMHO it would be useful to start a JIRA to track build issues that could be planned for the 170x. Damjan should weigh in on this issue as the release manager I think broader build system changes would probably not appropriate for 17.04 release.",
