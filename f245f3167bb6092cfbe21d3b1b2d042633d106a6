      "message": "thanks for the feedback.\ni dont think a link status change is the right trigger for that because we dont seem to get a notification if the vhost-user server changes the queue states (enables or disables queues individually). if this happens, vpp would rejiggle my tx assignments without letting me know. and there\u0027s no way today i can use the api to query each vhost user vring state. \nit sounds to me that leveraging the trigger in the vhost-user code in vpp and having it doing the assignment is a simpler approach here.",

      "message": "So, to clarify, you\u0027re saying that \n\n- the list of enabled queues changes inside the VM, the thread-queue would need to change for the interface to continue to work correctly\n\n- changing the list of enabled queues inside the VM does not generate this event\n\n- therefore, using an API in response to his event, as Mohsin suggests, will not change the pinning when it needs to be changed\n\nIs that it?",

      "message": "yes. that sounds correct.\ni have tried changing the enabled queues on a linux vm on qemu but did not see an event come out of vpp.\nin addition to that, there is no api message or field that lets me know which queues are actually active (ex: a vhost-user frontend may negotiate 8 queues but only 2 queues are enabled) - and if i do any assignment on disabled queues packets would be blackholed",
