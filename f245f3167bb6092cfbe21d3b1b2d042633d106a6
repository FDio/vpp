      "message": "thanks for the feedback.\ni dont think a link status change is the right trigger for that because we dont seem to get a notification if the vhost-user server changes the queue states (enables or disables queues individually). if this happens, vpp would rejiggle my tx assignments without letting me know. and there\u0027s no way today i can use the api to query each vhost user vring state. \nit sounds to me that leveraging the trigger in the vhost-user code in vpp and having it doing the assignment is a simpler approach here.",
