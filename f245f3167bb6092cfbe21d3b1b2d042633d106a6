      "message": "thanks for the feedback.\ni dont think a link status change is the right trigger for that because we dont seem to get a notification if the vhost-user server changes the queue states (enables or disables queues individually). if this happens, vpp would rejiggle my tx assignments without letting me know. and there\u0027s no way today i can use the api to query each vhost user vring state. \nit sounds to me that leveraging the trigger in the vhost-user code in vpp and having it doing the assignment is a simpler approach here.",

      "message": "So, to clarify, you\u0027re saying that \n\n- the list of enabled queues changes inside the VM, the thread-queue would need to change for the interface to continue to work correctly\n\n- changing the list of enabled queues inside the VM does not generate this event\n\n- therefore, using an API in response to his event, as Mohsin suggests, will not change the pinning when it needs to be changed\n\nIs that it?",
