      "message": "Hi linux-cp experts, appreciate your feedback on this change. I added it to support LAG in the Sonic-VPP project: https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-platform-vpp/issues/140\n\nThe change is inspired by the discussions in https://lists.fd.io/g/vpp-dev/message/23417 and https://lists.fd.io/g/vpp-dev/topic/96476162.\n\nNote that I currently enable this functionality based on the presence of the LACP plugin (for which I had to add a variable). I could change that to be an API if preferred (eg. lcp \u003cenable|disable\u003e \u003cethertype\u003e or some other form of API).\n\nThank you,\nAkeel",
