      "message": "Hi, Stanislav,\nThis seem to be reasonable as a fix, however I don\u0027t get how that can cause your issue.\nNext frames for the worker should be freed on the very next line after the loop, so I believe the only ways NULL frame can be accessed at this point are data race read/copy from another thread and use-after-free, both of which are so bad I doubt we can meaningfully protect from them here.",
