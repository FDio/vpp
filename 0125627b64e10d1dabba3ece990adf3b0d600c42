      "message": "this patch is changing VPP behaviour to add a checksum in the tunnel cases where we used to have 0 value as a checkusm. A zero value is valid both for v4 (where the chksum is always optional) and v6 (RFC6935) when the UDP payload is a a tunneled packet (and so the payload is protected by the chksum of the inner packet.). So IMO DPDK is wrong in identifying these packets as having invalid chksums.",
