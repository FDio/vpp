      "message": "This function, by construction, removes the connection\u0027s flow from the lookup table. It\u0027s not the place to add additional logic meant to deal with listener cleanup.\n\nInstead, there are two options:\n1) make sure in session_stop_listen that the session ip/port are 0-ed for listeners that are DGRAM transports, i.e., if session_tx_is_dgram(s)\n2) Make zero ip/port in udp_push_header if the connection is a marked as a listener. \n\nOut of the two, I prefer 2 because it avoids inaccurate reporting in \"show session\" cli. That is, a listener shouldn\u0027t have a remote ip/port. The problem however is that we don\u0027t mark udp connections as listeners so doing that is a bit more involved.",
