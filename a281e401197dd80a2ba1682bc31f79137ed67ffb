      "message": "Just pondering. Hypothetically we might want ip4-inacl before *everything*. (whether true or not, just posit this for the scenario)\n\nIf someone adds a feature that is merely \"before ip4-lookup\" is the algo likely to always put it as adjacent to ip4-lookup as it can get? (Noting other features may have the same constraint this would imply they\u0027ll all end up in a group of indeterminate order adjacent to ip4-lookup)\n\nOr will it end up \"anywhere before\" it, possibly before \"in-acl\" and if so, how might we further constrain things per my posit above?\n\nI\u0027ve only used the algo before for graph path testing, not sorting, so I don\u0027t know the answer to this off the top of my head.",
