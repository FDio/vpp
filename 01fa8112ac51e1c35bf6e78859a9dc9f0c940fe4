I was not trying to indicate that the mpls xc node should not be enabled during pair creation with my comment about enabling/disabling MPLS on an interface. I was trying to advocate for the opposite - that as much automatic setup as possible could be done when a pair is created so nothing needs to be touched later. In any case, I\u0027ll merge it as is and maybe additional automation can be added at some point in the future.",
