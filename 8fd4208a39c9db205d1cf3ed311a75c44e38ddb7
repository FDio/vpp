      "message": "Thanks for the review Matt. Yes, there are cases where internal prefix is larger than the external prefix. E.g. ULA of /48 and external of /56. That case results in a set of untranslatable prefixes on the inside.\nAdded a check to ensure prefixes are shorter or equal to 64.\nFirst go, so I expect we have to make some changes and improvements over time.\nFor example an integration with DHCPv6 PD, so that the binding can be dynamic.\n\nGreat if you have a need and give this a spin. Revamping my home to use this, but it\u0027s going to be a week or two for that to happen.",
