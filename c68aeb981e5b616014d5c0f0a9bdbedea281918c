      "message": "I understand re-using the existing erase code to make this work; however redrawing the remainder of the line for every character erased is pretty inefficient. It would be okay for a first-approximation, but I wonder if you could rework this to defer redrawing the rest of the line until after moving the cursor left.\n\nSomething like, perhaps:\nmove left delta times\nredraw remainder of line\nprint delta amount of blank spaces,\nthen finally fix the cursor position.",
