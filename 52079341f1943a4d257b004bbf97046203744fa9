      "message": "Hi Fan, I was wondering how head doesn\u0027t overflow tail without a check. It seems that it won\u0027t happen as ring size is exactly as max number of available async frames which is VNET_CRYPTO_FRAME_POOL_SIZE. However if I take a look at the implementation of vnet_crypto_async_get_frame, a new async frame is obtained by calling pool_get_aligned. In case pool is exhausted this call will lead to the pool resizing - which would be a disaster, as we operate on pointers, not their indices. So my question is - is it a bug, or we know that in our setup such scenario will not take place - as it is not obvious to me.",

      "message": "I think these lines are correct: in 117 head is used before incrementation - so it has correct value, when we reach 118 head is incremented and may be overflown, but 118 fix that and corrects the head value. Effectively head is from the range [0, VNET_CRYPTO_FRAME_POOL_SIZE - 1]. On the other hand if we would do what you suggest, we would start filling the ring from frames[1] element instead of frames[0] - to me it looks as a matter of choosing convention - or am I missing something?",
