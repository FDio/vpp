      "message": "when we say \"fixes unaligned access\" what do we really mean?\nthe ipX_address_t and ipX_header_t structures are already \u0027packed\u0027 in the sense that there is no padding within them. Declaring them to be packed doesn\u0027t change the location of an address nor a header within a buffer; they go where the driver puts them, so the access is still unaligned.\nIs what we are addressing here a UBSAN behaviour where it flags unaligned access as undefined if they are on a structure that is not marked as packed and therefore not \u0027expected\u0027?",
