      "message": "I think a smaller change in the limit would be better. The current maximum instance is 1024. I think increasing it to 8192 and starting to allocate linux-cp taps from 4096 should be sufficient.\n\nThe reason is that if you start allocating linux-cp taps from an offset of 60k, you\u0027re going to have to have a bitmap with room for 60k bits \u003d around 8k bytes and nearly all of it will be empty. Its not the world\u0027s biggest waste of memory, but I think starting at 4096 and only wasting 512 bytes will probably be good enough.",

      "message": "currently args-\u003eid \u003d\u003d ~0 indicates that you auto select an id.\nThe patch adds another knob that is also a boolean that indicates that an id should be auto selected.\n\nIt seems like it would be more straightforward to keep the current behavior: args-\u003eid \u003d\u003d ~0 indicates \"auto select\". Then add a new field like args-\u003eauto_id_offset or something like that. When args-\u003eid \u003d\u003d ~0, args-\u003eid \u003d clib_bitmap_next_clear (tm-\u003etap_ids, args-\u003eauto_id_offset % TAP_MAX_INSTANCE)). When a specific offset is passed by linux-cp, it will be used. In other cases where 0 is passed in tap_create_if() should behave like it does now.",
