But what about sending data packets when the confirmation (data packet) has not received yet. It looks like the current implementation allows to send data packets without any confirmation. Do you think this also needs a fix?",

[...] Therefore, after the initiator receives the response from the responder, if it has no data packets immediately queued up to send, it should send an empty packet, so as to provide this confirmation.\n\nIt looks like it does not necessarily will be a keepalive message. Instead, it might be a normal encrypted data packet. This packet will be a keepalive message only if the initiator\u0027s output queue is empty at that moment.\n\nWhat do you think?",
