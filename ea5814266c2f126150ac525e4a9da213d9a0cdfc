      "message": "This change *looks* fine. That having been said, I\u0027ve seen a number of corner-case misbehaviors when working on the clib time code. Things to check might include [simulating] a transition from 1/1/1970 [time 0] to the present, simulating a jump back in time [non-volatile clock running fast, NTP corrects the problem after VPP starts] and so on.\n\nThe TCP host stack often has millions of concurrent timers running; you can imagine the mess if there\u0027s an unobvious flaw in this patch.",
