Otherwise we\u0027ll have 2 maintain 2 completely separate codepath, which makes it hard to test \u0026 maintain.\n- the 1st one processing desc 4-by-4 and the 2nd one 1-by-1\n- the 4-by-4 loop will use AVX512 if defined otherwise can ue scalar code (or even better, also have a AVX256 variant in addition to AVX512 and scalar!)\nSee https://git.fd.io/vpp/tree/src/plugins/af_xdp/output.c#n37 for an example",
