And svm_fifo_init_pointers() is updated.\nThen, maybe I\u0027m wrong but I wonder if this svm_fifo_init_pointers() wouldn\u0027t hit the ASSERT\n      c \u003d svm_fifo_find_chunk (f, tail);\n      ASSERT (c !\u003d 0);\nsince f contains only 2 chunks at this point,\n  (1) start_byte \u003d 0, length \u003d 201,\n  (2) start_bytes \u003d 201, length \u003d 100,\nand I suppose the second chunk does not contain f-\u003etail\u003d301.",

Most probable the grow and shrink ones will have to be completely rewritten because, amongst others, we won\u0027t have fifo wrapping anymore (as you\u0027re pointing out).\n\nInstead, we\u0027ll have to check that fifo chunks are allocated as requested/configured (especially after we add virtual-fifo-size to the fifo) and that state variables (e.g., head_chunk and ooo_enq) are properly updated.",
