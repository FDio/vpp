FD.io VPP: Vector Packet Processing
===================================

## Introduction.

The VPP platform is an extensible framework that provides out-of-the-box
production quality switch/router functionality. It is the open source version
of Cisco's Vector Packet Processing (VPP) technology: a high performance,
packet-processing stack that can run on commodity CPUs.

The benefits of this implementation of VPP are its high performance, proven
technology, its modularity and flexibility, and rich feature set.

For more information on VPP and its features please visit the 
[FD.io](http://fd.io/) and
[What is VPP?](https://wiki.fd.io/view/VPP/What_is_VPP%3F) pages.

## Quick-start: On an existing Linux host.

To install system dependencies, build VPP and then install it, run
(as a non-privileged user with `sudo` access:

    ./build-root/vagrant/build.sh

If you want a more fine-grained approach because you intend to do some
development work, the `Makefile` in the root directory of the source tree
provides several convenience targets that may be of interest.

To install any required dependencies (assuming you have GNU Make available):

    make install-dep

To build a debugging version of VPP:

    make build

To run GDB on a built debugging version of VPP:

    make debug

To see what other convenience shortcuts are available:

    make


## Quick-start: Vagrant.

The directory `build-root/vagrant` contains a `VagrantFile` and
supporting scripts to bootstrap a working VPP inside a Vagrant-managed
Virtual Machine. This VM can then be used to test concepts with VPP
or as a development platform for it.

For this to work you will need a working installation of Vagrant.
