      "message": "As far as I understand, TARGET_PLATFORM is not being used. The whole purpose of TARGET_PLATFORM check in build-data/packages/vpp.mk  can only be when somebody is doing cross compilation for thunderx.\n\nTARGET_PLATFORM is controlling passing proper T\u003d$(DPDK_TARGET) to dpdk.mk. In native compilation, dpdk.mk has valid checks to determine DPDK_TARGET hence do not require caller passing it from external. Passing DPDK_TARGET to dpdk.mk can only be used in cross compilation but for that matter build-data/platforms/thunderx.mk should be added instead of changing build-data/packages/vpp.mk\n\nSo I think TARGET_PLATFORM is not required even in this patch. But this is not a blocker for this patch. That can be addressed in later patch. So +1 for my side",
