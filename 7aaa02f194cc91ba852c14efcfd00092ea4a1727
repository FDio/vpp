      "message": "There should be no reset notification on a session that doesn\u0027t have fifos. So what is the exact scenario?\n\nIf this is a reset that wants to propagate from tls to the app on a session that\u0027s not yet been established, i.e., handshake has not completed, that needs to be handled in tls. For instance, if a connect from the app into tls is about to be reset, tls needs to generate a connect failed, not a reset notify. TLS can generate a reset notify only if the session was previously established, i.e., the app was notified that the session was connected.",
