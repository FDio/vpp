      "message": "hs_apps are used in some of the make test testcases, but are external traffic generators.  We don\u0027t include test coverage for iperf, so I figured there\u0027s no need to report on the hs_apps either.\n\n@Florin, what do you think?\n\nFor complete test coverage of VPP Hoststack, the tests run under extras/hs-test framework will need to be run with coverage instrumentation. However, Hs-test testing is not running in the CI. Once that is in place, I will work on adding that coverage data to the daily coverage report job.",
