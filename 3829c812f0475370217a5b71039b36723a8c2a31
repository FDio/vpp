If possible, I\u0027d like to look for alternatives. \n\nOne idea would be to create the vcl session but once we detect the connect/bind is to localhost (and if the feature is enabled), we allocate a linux fd, add the two to an ldp worker hash table, and then after ldp_fd_to_vlsh do something like:\n\nif (PREDICT_FALSE (ldp_no_lh_sockets ())) \n  ldp_maybe_update_fd_vlsh (\u0026fd, \u0026vlsh);\n\nAnd ldp_maybe_update_fd_vlsh will set vlsh to invalid and fd to the actual linux fd if one was configured. That will force execution of linux apis and keep all of this local to ldp.\n\nThis could probably even be integrated directly into ldp_fd_to_vlsh, with some changes.",

Is the issue the fact that we don\u0027t support all the options or something more fundamental?\n\nI might need a refresher, as it\u0027s been a while since I last looked at this, but the original comment still looks like something that we should use as a guiding principle. That is, the thing we\u0027re missing is a way to selectively \"route\" (as you put it) socket calls to either linux or vls. Now, because that is something that only ldp could understand, most of the logic should be there, although we might need some support from vls/vcl (e.g., dump all attributes for a session handle).\n\nI assume there\u0027s now way to detect what way a socket wants to go before connect/bind, is there?",
