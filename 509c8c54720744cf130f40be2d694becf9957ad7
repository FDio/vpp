      "message": "Good point. It should never happen unless there is some kind of memory corruption. The question is then - do we return an error or still try to delete the tunnel even under corrupted state? If we proceed to delete the tunnel and check pvtep against null before de-refencing it later in the code without returning any error, would that be a preferred approach?",
