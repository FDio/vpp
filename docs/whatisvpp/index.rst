=================================
The Vector Packet Processor (VPP)
=================================

This section describes some of the core concepts and features of FD.io VPP.

To start with FD.io VPP uses a technique called Vector Packet Processing.
This gives FD.io VPP a siginficant performance improvement over packet
processing applications that use scalar processing. 

Also, At the heart of Fd.io VPP's modular design is a 'Packet Processing Graph'.
This makes FD.io VPP scalable and easily extensible.

The FD.io software also includes a feature rich network stack. This includes
a TCP host stack that utilizes VPPâ€™s graph based forwarding model and vectorized
packet processing.

FD.io VPP is tested nightly for functionality and performance with the
CSIT project.
