Reporting Bugs
==============

Although every situation is different, this section describes how to
collect data which will help make efficient use of everyone's time
when dealing with vpp bugs.

FD.io's Jira server can be found at `jira.fd.io <https://jira.fd.io>`_

Before you press the Jira button to create a bug report - or email
vpp-dev@lists.fd.io - please ask yourself whether there's enough
information for someone else to understand and to reproduce the issue
given a reasonable amount of effort. **Unicast emails to maintainers,
committers, and the project PTL are strongly discouraged.**

A good strategy for clear-cut bugs: file a detailed Jira ticket, and
then send a short description of the issue to vpp-dev@lists.fd.io,
perhaps from the Jira ticket description. It's fine to send email to
vpp-dev@lists.fd.io to ask a few questions **before** filing Jira tickets.
