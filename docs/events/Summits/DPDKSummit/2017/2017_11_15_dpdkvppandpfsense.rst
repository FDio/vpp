DPDK, VPP and pfSense 3.0
#########################

Event
-----

pfSense is a open source firewall/vpn appliance,
based on FreeBSD, started in 2006 with over 1M active installs.
We are basing pfSense release 3.0 on FD.io's VPP,
leveraging key DPDK components including cryptodev,
while adding a CLI and RESTCONF layer, 
leveraging FRRouting and Strongswan.

This presentation was held during the 2017 DPDK Summit
 on September 26th, 2017.
