What is the Vector Packet Processor (VPP)
#########################################

FD.io's Vector Packet Processor (VPP) is a fast, scalable layer 2-4
multi-platform network stack. It runs in `Linux Userspace <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_space>`_ 
on multiple architectures including x86, ARM, and Power architectures.
VPP is built using the `Dataplane Development Kit (DPDK) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Plane_Development_Kit>`_.

It's benefits are its high performance, proven technology, modularity, and rich feature set.

VPP supports integration with OpenStack and Kubernetes. Network management
features include configuration, counters, sampling and more. For developers, VPP
includes plugin extensibility, high-performance event-logging, and multiple
kinds of packet tracing. Debug images can be built. These images include debug
symbols and extensive consistency checking.

Some VPP  Use-cases include vSwitchs, vRouters, Gateways, Firewalls and Load
Balancers, to name just a few. Out of the box, VPP can work as a software
development kit or an appliance.
