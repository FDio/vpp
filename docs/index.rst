What is the Vector Packet Processor (VPP)
#########################################

FD.io's Vector Packet Processor (VPP) is a fast, scalable layer 2-4
multi-platform network stack. It runs in `Linux Userspace <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_space>`_
on multiple architectures including x86, ARM, and Power architectures.
VPP is built using the `Dataplane Development Kit (DPDK) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Plane_Development_Kit>`_.

VPP benefits include high performance, proven technology, modularity,
and a rich feature set.

VPP supports integration with OpenStack and Kubernetes. Network
management features include configuration, counters, sampling and
more. For developers, VPP includes plugin extensibility,
high-performance event-logging, and multiple kinds of packet
tracing. Development debug images include complete symbol tables, and
extensive consistency checking.

Some VPP Use-cases include vSwitches, vRouters, Gateways, Firewalls
and Load Balancers, to name a few. Out of the box, VPP can work as a
software development kit or an appliance.
