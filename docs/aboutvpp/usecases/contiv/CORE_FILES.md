# Capturing VPP core dumps
In order to debug a crash of VPP, it is required to provide a coredump file, which allows backtracing of the VPP issue. The following items are the requirements for capturing a coredump:

#### 1. Disable k8s Probes to Prevent k8s from Restarting the POD with a Crashed VPP
As described in [BUG_REPORTS.md](BUG_REPORTS.html#collecting-the-logs-in-case-of-crash-loop).

#### 2. Modify VPP Startup config file
In `/etc/vpp/contiv-vswitch.conf`, add the following lines into the `unix` section:

```
unix {
    ...
    coredump-size unlimited
    full-coredump
}
```

#### 3. Turn on Coredumps in the Vswitch Container
After re-deploying Contiv-VPP networking, enter bash shell in the vswitch 
container (use actual name of the vswitch POD - `contiv-vswitch-7whk7` in this case):
```
kubectl exec -it contiv-vswitch-7whk7 -n kube-system -c contiv-vswitch bash
```

Enable coredumps:
```
mkdir -p /tmp/dumps
sysctl -w debug.exception-trace=1 
sysctl -w kernel.core_pattern="/tmp/dumps/%e-%t"
ulimit -c unlimited
echo 2 > /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable
```

#### 4. Let VPP Crash
Now repeat the steps that lead to the VPP crash. You can also force VPP to crash at the point where it is 
running (e.g., if it is stuck) by using the SIGQUIT signal:
```
kill -3 `pidof vpp`
```

#### 5. Locate and Inspect the Core File
The core file should appear in `/tmp/dumps` in the container:
```
cd /tmp/dumps
ls
vpp_main-1524124440
```

You can try to backtrace, after installing gdb:
```
apt-get update && apt-get install gdb
gdb vpp vpp_main-1524124440
(gdb) bt
```

#### 6. Copy the Core File Out of the Container
Finally, copy the core file out of the container. First, while still inside the container,
pack the core file into an archive:

```
cd /tmp/dumps
tar cvzf vppdump.tar.gz vpp_main-1524124440
```

Now, on the host, determine the docker ID of the container, and then copy the file out of the host:
```
docker ps | grep vswitch_contiv
d7aceb2e4876        c43a70ac3d01                                             "/usr/bin/supervisorâ€¦"   25 minutes ago      Up 25 minutes                           k8s_contiv-vswitch_contiv-vswitch-zqzn6_kube-system_9923952f-43a6-11e8-be84-080027de08ea_0

docker cp d7aceb2e4876:/tmp/dumps/vppdump.tar.gz .
```

Now you are ready to file a bug in [jira.fd.io](https://jira.fd.io/) and attach the core file.
