Container-based network simulation
==================================

The "make test" framework provides a good way to test individual
features. However, when testing several features at once - or
validating nontrivial configurations - it may prove difficult or
impossible to use the unit-test framework.

This note explains how to set up lxc/lxd, and a 5-container testbed to
test a split-tunnel nat + ikev2 + ipsec + ipv6 prefix-delegation
scenario.

OS / Distro test results
========================

This setup has been tested on an Ubuntu 18.04 LTS system. If you're
feeling adventurous, the same scenario also worked on a recent Ubuntu
20.04 "preview" daily build.

Other distros may work fine, or not at all.

Proxy Server
============

If you need to use a proxy server e.g. from a lab system, you'll
probably need to set HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, http_proxy and
https_proxy in /etc/environment. Directly setting variables in the
environment doesn't work. The lxd snap _daemon_ needs the proxy settings,
not the user interface.

Something like so:

```
    HTTP_PROXY=http://my.proxy.server:8080
    HTTPS_PROXY=http://my.proxy.server:4333
    http_proxy=http://my.proxy.server:8080
    https_proxy=http://my.proxy.server:4333
```

Install and configure lxd
=========================

Install the lxd snap. The lxd snap is up to date, as opposed to the
results of "sudo apt-get install lxd".

```
    # snap install lxd
    # lxd init
```

"lxd init" asks several questions. With the exception of the storage
pool, take the defaults. To match the configs shown below, create a
storage pool named "vpp." Storage pools of type "zfs" and "files" have
been tested successfully.

zfs is more space-efficient. "lxc copy" is infinitely faster with
zfs. The path for the zfs storage pool is under /var. Do not replace
it with a symbolic link, unless you want to rebuild all of your
containers from scratch. Ask me how I know that.

Create three network segments
=============================

Aka, linux bridges.

```
    # lxc network create dora
    # lxc network create internet
    # lxc network create swan
```

We'll explain the test topology in a bit. Stay tuned.

Set up the default container profile
====================================

Execute "lxc profile edit default", and install the following
configuration. Note that the "shared" directory should mount your vpp
workspaces. With that trick, you can edit code from any of the
containers, run vpp without installing it, etc.

```
    config: {}
    description: Default LXD profile
    devices:
      eth0:
        name: eth0
        network: lxdbr0
        type: nic
      eth1:
        name: eth1
        nictype: bridged
        parent: internet
        type: nic
      eth2:
        name: eth2
        nictype: bridged
        parent: dora
        type: nic
      eth3:
        name: eth3
        nictype: bridged
        parent: swan
        type: nic
      root:
        path: /
        pool: vpp
        type: disk
      shared:
        path: /scratch
        source: /scratch
        type: disk
    name: default
```

Set up the network configurations
=================================

Edit the fake "internet" backbone:

```
  # lxc network edit internet
```

Install the ip addresses shown below, to avoid having to rebuild the vpp
and host configuration:

```
    config:
      ipv4.address: 10.26.68.1/24
      ipv4.dhcp.ranges: 10.26.68.10-10.26.68.50
      ipv4.nat: "true"
      ipv6.address: none
      ipv6.nat: "false"
    description: ""
    name: internet
    type: bridge
    used_by:
    managed: true
    status: Created
    locations:
    - none
```

Repeat the process with the "dora" and "swan" networks, using these
configurations:

### dora network configuration

```
    config:
      ipv4.address: 10.166.14.1/24
      ipv4.dhcp.ranges: 10.166.14.10-10.166.14.50
      ipv4.nat: "true"
      ipv6.address: none
      ipv6.nat: "false"
    description: ""
    name: dora
    type: bridge
    used_by:
    managed: true
    status: Created
    locations:
    - none
```
### swan network configuration

```
    config:
      ipv4.address: 10.219.188.1/24
      ipv4.dhcp.ranges: 10.219.188.10-10.219.188.50
      ipv4.nat: "true"
      ipv6.address: none
      ipv6.nat: "false"
    description: ""
    name: swan
    type: bridge
    used_by:
    managed: true
    status: Created
    locations:
    - none
```

Create a "master" container image
=================================

The master container image should be set up so that you can
build vpp, ssh into the container, edit source code, run gdb, etc.

Make sure that e.g. public key auth ssh works.

```
    # lxd launch ubuntu:18.04 dora
    <spew>
    # lxc exec dora bash
    dora# cd /scratch/my-vpp-workspace
    dora# apt-get install make ssh
    dora# make install-dep
    dora# exit
    # lxc stop dora
```

Mark the container image privileged. If you forget this step, you'll
trip over a netlink error (-11) aka EAGAIN when you try to roll in the
vpp configurations.

```
    # lxc config set dora security.privileged "true"
```

Duplicate the "master" container image
======================================

To avoid having to configure N containers, be sure that the master
container image is fully set up before you help it have children:

```
    # lxc copy dora dorahost
    # lxc copy dora swan
    # lxc copy dora swanhost
    # lxc copy dora dhcpserver    # optional, to test ipv6 prefix delegation
```

Install handy script
====================

See below for a handly script which executes lxc commands across the
current set of running containers. I call it "lxc-foreach," feel free
to call the script Ishmael if you like.

Examples:

```
    $ lxc-foreach start
    <issues "lxc start" for each container in the list>
```

After a few seconds, use this one to open an ssh connection to each
container. The ssh command parses the output of "lxc info," which
displays container ip addresses.

```
    $ lxc-foreach ssh
```

Here's the script:

```
    #!/bin/bash

    set -u
    export containers="dora dorahost swan swanhost dhcpserver"

    if [ x$1 = "x" ] ; then
        echo missing command
        exit 1
    fi

    if [ $1 = "ssh" ] ; then
        for c in $containers
        do
            inet=`lxc info $c | grep eth0 | grep -v inet6 | head -1 | cut -f 3`
            if [ x$inet = "x" ] ; then
                echo $c not started
            else
                gnome-terminal --command "/usr/bin/ssh $inet"
            fi
        done
    exit 0
    fi

    for c in $containers
    do
        echo lxc $1 $c
        lxc $1 $c
    done

    exit 0
```

Test topology

Finally, we're ready to describe a test topology. First, a picture:

### Test topology discussion

This topology is suitable for testing almost any tunnel encap/decap
scenario.  The two containers "dorahost" and "swanhost" are end-stations
connected to two vpp instances running on "dora" and "swan".

We leverage the Linux end-station network stacks to generate traffic
of all sorts.

The so-called "internet" bridge models the public internet. The "dora" and
"swan" bridges connect vpp instances to local hosts

End station configs
===================

The end-station Linux configurations set up the eth2 and eth3 ip
addresses shown above, and add tunnel routes to the opposite
end-station networks.

### dorahost configuration

```
    ifconfig eth2 10.166.14.3/24 up
    route add -net 10.219.188.0/24 gw 10.166.14.2
```

### swanhost configuration

```
    sudo ifconfig eth3 10.219.188.3/24 up
    sudo route add -net 10.166.14.0/24 gw 10.219.188.2
```

VPP configs
===========

Split nat44 / ikev2 + ipsec tunneling, with ipv6 prefix delegation in
the "dora" config.

    set int unnum ipip0 use host-eth1
    ip route add 10.166.14.0/24 via ipip0
```

IKEv2 certificate setup
=======================

In both of the vpp configurations, you'll see "/scratch/setups/xxx.pem"
mentioned. These certificates are used in the ikev2 key exchange.

Here's how to generate the certificates:

```
    openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout dorakey.pem -out doracert.pem -days 3560
    openssl x509 -text -noout -in doracert.pem
    openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout swankey.pem -out swancert.pem -days 3560
    openssl x509 -text -noout -in swancert.pem
```

Make sure that the "dora" and "swan" configurations point to the certificates.

DHCPv6 server setup
===================

If you need an ipv6 dhcp server to test ipv6 prefix delegation,
create the "dhcpserver" container as shown above.

Install the "isc-dhcp-server" Debian package:

```
    sudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-server
```

### /etc/dhcp/dhcpd6.conf

Edit the dhcpv6 configuration and add an ipv6 subnet with prefix
delegation. For example:

```
    subnet6 2001:db01:0:1::/64 {
            range6 2001:db01:0:1::1 2001:db01:0:1::9;
            prefix6 2001:db01:0:100:: 2001:db01:0:200::/56;
    }
```

Add an ipv6 address on eth1, which is connected to the "internet"
bridge, and start the dhcp server. I use the following trivial bash
script, which runs the dhcp6 server in the foreground and produces
dhcp traffic spew:

```
    #!/bin/bash
    ifconfig eth1 inet6 add 2001:db01:0:1::10/64 || true
    dhcpd -6 -d -cf /etc/dhcp/dhcpd6.conf
```

The "|| true" bit keeps going if eth1 already has the indicated ipv6
address.

Container / Host Interoperation
===============================

Host / container interoperation is highly desirable. If the host and a
set of containers don't run the same distro _and distro version_, it's
reasonably likely that the glibc versions won't match. That, in turn,
makes vpp binaries built in one environment fail in the other.

Trying to install multiple versions of glibc - especially at the host
level - often ends very badly and is _not recommended_. It's not just
glibc, either. The dynamic loader ld-linux-xxx-so.2 is glibc version
specific.

Fortunately, it's reasonable easy to build lxd container images based on
specific Ubuntu or Debian versions.

### Create a custom root filesystem image

First, install the "debootstrap" tool:

```
    sudo apt-get install debootstrap
```

Make a temp directory, and use debootstrap to populate it. In this
example, we create an Ubuntu 20.04 (focal fossa) base image:

```
    # mkdir /tmp/myroot
    # debootstrap focal /tmp/myroot http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
```

To tinker with the base image (if desired):

```
    # chroot /tmp/myroot
    <add packages, etc.>
    # exit
```

Make a compressed tarball of the base image:

```
    # tar zcf /tmp/rootfs.tar.gz -C /tmp/myroot .
```

Create a "metadata.yaml" file which describes the base image:

```
    architecture: "x86_64"
    # To get current date in Unix time, use `date +%s` command
    creation_date: 1458040200
    properties:
    architecture: "x86_64"
    description: "My custom Focal Fossa image"
    os: "Ubuntu"
    release: "focal"
```

Make a compressed tarball of metadata.yaml:

```
    # tar zcf metadata.tar.gz metadata.yaml
```

Import the image into lxc / lxd:

```
    $ lxc image import metadata.tar.gz rootfd.tar.gz --alias focal-base
```

### Create a container which uses the customized base image:

```
    $ lxc launch focal-base focaltest
    $ lxc exec focaltest bash
```

The next several steps should be executed in the container, in the
bash shell spun up by "lxc exec..."

### Configure container networking

In the container, create /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml:

```
    network:
        version: 2
        ethernets:
            eth0:
                dhcp4: true
```

Use "cat > /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml", and cut-'n-paste if your
favorite text editor is AWOL.

Apply the configuration:

```
    # netplan apply
```

At this point, eth0 should have an ip address, and you should see
a default route with "route -n".

### Configure apt

Again, in the container, set up /etc/apt/sources.list via cut-'n-paste
from a recently update "focal fossa" host. Something like so:

```
    deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal main restricted
    deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal-updates main restricted
    deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal universe
    deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal-updates universe
    deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal multiverse
    deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal-updates multiverse
    deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal-backports main restricted universe multiverse
    deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu focal-security main restricted
    deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu focal-security universe
    deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu focal-security multiverse
```

"apt-get update" and "apt-install" should produce reasonable results.
Suggest "apt-get install make git".

At this point, you can use the "/scratch" sharepoint (or similar) to
execute "make install-dep install-ext-deps" to set up the container
with the vpp toolchain; proceed as desired.
