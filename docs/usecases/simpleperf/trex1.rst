Using VPP with TRex Mixed Traffic Templates
===========================================

In this example, a more complicated traffic with delay profile on *net2s22c05* is
generated using the traffic configuration file "avl/sfr_delay_10_1g.yaml":

.. code-block:: console

   NET2S22C05$ sudo ./t-rex-64 -f avl/sfr_delay_10_1g.yaml -c 2 -m 20 -d 100 -l 1000

On *csp2s22c03*, use the VCC CLI command show run to display the graph runtime statistics.
Observe that the average vector per node is 10.69 and 14.47:

Summary
=======

This tutorial showed how to download, compile, and install the VPP binary on an
IntelÂ® Architecture platform. Examples of /etc/sysctl.d/80-vpp.conf and
/etc/vpp/startup.conf/startup.conf configuration files were provided to get the
user up and running with VPP. The tutorial also illustrated how to detect and bind
the network interfaces to a DPDK-compatible driver. You can use the VPP CLI to assign
IP addresses to these interfaces and bring them up. Finally, four examples using iperf3
and TRex were included, to show how VPP processes packets in batches.
