VPP with Containers
====================

This section will cover connecting two Linux containers with VPP. A container is essentially a more efficient and faster VM, due to the fact that a container does not simulate a separate kernel and hardware. You can read more about `Linux containers here <https://linuxcontainers.org/>`_.

This section has been tested with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
