VPP inside the Cloud
====================

This section will cover the VPP deployment inside two different Public Cloud Provider: Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure. Furthermore, we describe how to interconnect several  Public Cloud Regions together with Segment Routing per IPv6 and we show some Performance Evaluation. Finally, we make our Terraform scripts available to the community, which could help in automating the VPP deployment inside the Cloud.
