## This stanza controls binary API tracing. Unless there is a very strong reason,

## Additional parameters:
##
## To set the number of binary API trace records in the circular buffer, configure nitems
##
## nitems <nnn> 
##
## To save the api message table decode tables, configure a filename. Results in /tmp/<filename>
## Very handy for understanding api message changes between versions, identifying missing
## plugins, and so forth.

	## In the VPP there is one main thread and optionally the user can create worker(s)
	## The main thread and worker thread(s) can be pinned to CPU core(s) manually or automatically

	## Manual pinning of thread(s) to CPU core(s)

	## Set logical CPU core where main thread runs
	# main-core 1

	## Set logical CPU core(s) where worker threads are running
	# corelist-workers 2-3,18-19

	## Automatic pinning of thread(s) to CPU core(s)

	## Sets number of CPU core(s) to be skipped (1 ... N-1)
	## Skipped CPU core(s) are not used for pinning main thread and working thread(s).
	## The main thread is automatically pinned to the first available CPU core and worker(s)
	## are pinned to next free CPU core(s) after core assigned to main thread
	# skip-cores 4

	## Specify a number of workers to be created
	## Workers are pinned to N consecutive CPU cores while skipping "skip-cores" CPU core(s)
	## and main thread's CPU core
	# workers 2

	## Set scheduling policy and priority of main and worker threads

	## Scheduling policy options are: other (SCHED_OTHER), batch (SCHED_BATCH)
	## idle (SCHED_IDLE), fifo (SCHED_FIFO), rr (SCHED_RR)
	# scheduler-policy fifo

	## Scheduling priority is used only for "real-time policies (fifo and rr),
	## and has to be in the range of priorities supported for a particular policy
	# scheduler-priority 50
