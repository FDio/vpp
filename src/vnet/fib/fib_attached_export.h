/**
 * FIB attached export
 *
 * what's it all about?
 * say one does this:
 *    set int ip table Gig0 2
 *    set int ip addr  Gig0 10.0.0.1/24
 * Ggi0 is in table 2 with a connected address.
 * Now we add a routing matching said connected in a different table
 *    ip route add table 3 10.0.0.0/24 via Gig0
 * How do we expect traffic in table 3 to be forwarded? Clearly out of
 * Ggi0. It's an attached route, hence we are saying that we can ARP for
 * hosts in the attached subnet. and we can. but any ARP entries we send
 * we be received on Gig0, but since Gig0 is in table 2, it will install
 * the adj-fins in table 2. So traffic in table 3 will never hit an adj-fib
 * and hence always the glean, and so thus be effectively dropped.
 * How do we fix this? Attached Export !! All more specfiic entries in table 2
 * that track and are covered by the connected are automatically exported into
 * table 3. Now table 3 also has adj-fibs (and the local) so traffic to hosts
 * is restored.
