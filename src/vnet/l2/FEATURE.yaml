name: Layer 2 Forwarding
maintainer: John Lo <loj@cisco.com>
features:
  - Layer 2 (L2) Cross-connect (xconnect) of two interfaces
  - Layer 2 (L2) Bridging of multiple interfaces in a bridge domain (BD):
      - Forwarding via destination MAC address of packet
      - MAC learning enable/disable on BD or per interface
      - MAC aging with specified aging interval enable/disable
      - MAC flush of learned MACs on interface down, BD deletion, or by user
      - User added static MACs not subject to aging nor overwritten by MAC learn
      - User added MACs not subject to aging but can be overwritten by MAC learn
      - Unicast forwarding enable/disable
      - Unknown unicast flooding enable/disable
      - Multicast/broadcast flooding enable/disable
      - ARP-termination to avoid flooding of ARP requests
      - Enable/disable unicast of ARP requests instead of flooding
      - BVI (Bridge Virtual Interface) for IP forwarding from or to BD
      - Set interface in BD to send unknown unicast packets instead of flooding
      - Support of split horizon group (SHG) on BD interfaces
  - VLAN tag rewrite on L2 bridging or xconnect interfaces
