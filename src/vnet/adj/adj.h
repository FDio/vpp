/**
 * An adjacency is a representation of an attached L3 peer.
 *
 * Adjacency Sub-types:
 *   - neighbour: a representation of an attached L3 peer.
 *                Key:{addr,interface,link/ether-type}
 *           SHARED
 *   - glean: used to drive ARP/ND for packets destined to a local sub-net.
 *            'glean' mean use the packet's destination address as the target
 *            address in the ARP packet.
 *          UNSHARED. Only one per-interface.
 *   - midchain: a nighbour adj on a virtual/tunnel interface.
 *   - rewrite: an adj with no key, but with a rewrite string.
 *
 * The API to create and update the adjacency is very sub-type specific. This
 * is intentional as it encourages the user to carefully consider which adjacency
 * sub-type they are really using, and hence assign it data in the appropriate
 * sub-type space in the union of sub-types. This prevents the adj becoming a
 * disorganised dumping group for 'my features needs a u16 somewhere' data. It
 * is important to enforce this approach as space in the adjacency is a premium,
 * as we need it to fit in 1 cache line.
 *
 * the API is also based around an index to an ajdacency not a raw pointer. This
 * is so the user doesn't suffer the same limp inducing firearm injuries that
 * the author suffered as the adjacenices can realloc.
