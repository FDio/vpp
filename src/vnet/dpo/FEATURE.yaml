features:
  - A DPO is a generic term (a.k.a abstract base class) for objects that
    perform [a set of] actions on packets in the data-plane
  - Concrete examples of DPO types are; adjacency, mpls-imposition, replication.
  - DPOs are stacked/joined to form a processing graph that packets traverse
    to describe the full set of actions a packet should experience.
  - DPO graphs can be rooted at any point in the VLIB graph - notable examples
    are L3 FIB lookup, ABF, L3XC.
