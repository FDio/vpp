name: ACLs for Security Groups
maintainer: Andrew Yourtchenko <ayourtch@gmail.com>
features:
  - Inbound MACIP ACLs:
      - filter the source IP:MAC address statically configured bindings
  - Stateless inbound and outbound ACLs:
      - permit/deny packets based on their L3/L4 info
  - Stateful inbound and outbound ACLs:
      - create inbound sessions based on outbound traffic and vice versa

description: |-
        The ACL plugin allows to implement access control policies
        at the levels of IP address ownership (by locking down
        the IP-MAC associations by MACIP ACLs), and by using network
        and transport level policies in inbound and outbound ACLs.
        For non-initial fragments the matching is done on network
        layer only. The session state in stateful ACLs is maintained
        per-interface (e.g. outbound interface ACL creates the session
        while inbound ACL matches it), which simplifies the design
        and operation. For TCP handling, the session processing
        tracks "established" (seen both SYN segments and seen ACKs for them),
        and "transient" (all the other TCP states) sessions.
