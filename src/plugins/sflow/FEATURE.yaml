       This plugin implements the random packet-sampling and interface
       telemetry streaming required to support standard sFlow export
       on Linux platforms. The overhead incurred by this monitoring is
       minimal, so that detailed, real-time traffic analysis can be
       achieved even under high load conditions, with visibility into
       any fields that appear in the packet headers. If the linux-cp
       plugin is running then interfaces will be mapped to their
       equivalent Linux tap ports.
