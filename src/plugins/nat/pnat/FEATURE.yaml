description: "Match packet against rule and translate according to given instructions.
              Rules are kept in a flow cache bihash. Instructions in a pool of translation entries.

              For a given interface/direction all rules must use the same lookup mask. E.g. SA + SP.

              A dynamic NAT would punt to slow path on a miss in the flow cache, in this case the miss behaviour is configurable.
              Default behaviour is pass packet along unchanged."
