features:
  - Destination based address/port translation
  - Conditional sourceNATing based on prefix exclusions

description: "This plugin is intended to complement the VPP's plugin_nat for
              Cloud use-cases. It allows for source/destination address/port
              translation based on multiple criterias. It is intended to be modular
              enough so that one could write a use-case optimised translation function
              without having to deal with actually re-writing packets or maintining
              sessions.
              This plugin supports multithreading. Workers share a unique bihash where
              sessions are stored."
