description: "This plugin implements NPTv6 as described in RFC6296.
              It supports arbitrary prefix lengths. And performs an
              algorithmic mapping between internal and external IPv6 prefixes.
              The mapping is checksum neutral.
              The implementation is currently limited to a single statically configured binding
              per interface.
              A typical IPv6 CE use case, the external prefix would be learnt via DHCP PD
              "
