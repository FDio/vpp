description: "Automatically create a Source Deny List (SDL) entry when the
	     traffic arrived meets the specified threshold. An example usage
	     is in TCP -- when TCP is flooded with SYN packets by the same
	     source that exceed the threshold, an SDL entry is automatically
	     created to deny a new TCP session to be created."
