name: Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol
maintainer: Matthew Smith <mgsmith@netgate.com>
features:
  - VRRPv3 (RFC 5798) for IPv4 and IPv6:
      - Signaling/advertisements and election of a master
      - Replies to ARP, NS requests for virtual router addresses
  - VRRP virtual MAC address support:
      - DPDK interfaces with PMD support for multiple MAC addresses via the
        rte_eth_dev_mac_addr_add(), rte_eth_dev_mac_addr_del()
      - Other interfaces which are set in promiscuous mode may work
  - Support interface types for VRRP virtual routers:
      - Hardware interfaces
      - VLAN subinterfaces
      - Bond interfaces
  - Additional features not specified in RFC 5798:
      - Allows sending advertisements to unicast peers instead of multicast
      - Allows a virtual router's priority to be adjusted based on the state
        of an upstream interface. Mentioned as a configuration option to
        "track interfaces or networks" in RFC 8347.
