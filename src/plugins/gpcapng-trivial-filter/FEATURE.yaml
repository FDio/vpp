description: |-
        GPCAPNG Trivial Filter provides a basic filter implementation
        for the Generic PCAPNG plugin with two simple modes: capture
        all packets to a specified destination, or capture no packets
        at all. This filter is useful for testing, debugging, and
        scenarios where simple on/off capture control is needed without
        complex packet analysis. The filter implementation uses VPP's
        multi-architecture compilation system to provide optimized
        variants for different CPU architectures. It serves as both
        a minimal working example of the filter API and a practical
        tool for basic capture scenarios.
