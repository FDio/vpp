/**
 * lb-plugin implements a MagLev-like load balancer.
 * http://research.google.com/pubs/pub44824.html
 *
 * It hasn't been tested for interoperability with the original MagLev
 * but intends to provide similar functionality.
 * The load-balancer receives traffic destined to VIP (Virtual IP)
 * addresses from one or multiple(ECMP) routers.
 * The load-balancer tunnels the traffic toward many application servers
 * ensuring session stickyness (i.e. that a single sessions is tunneled
 * towards a single application server).
