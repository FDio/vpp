name: Layer 3 cross connect
maintainer: Neale Ranns <nranns@cisco.com>
features:
  - cross connect all ingress traffic on an L3 interface to an output FIB path.
  - the path can describe any output (with the exception of MPLS labels)
  - The same functions can be acheived by using a dedicated VRF for the table
    and adding a default route with the same path. However, the L3XC is more
    efficient in memory and CPU
