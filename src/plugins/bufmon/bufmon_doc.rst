Buffers monitoring plugin
=========================

This plugin enables to track buffer utilization in the VPP graph nodes.
The main use is to detect buffer leakage. It works by keeping track of
number of buffer allocations and free in graph nodes and also of number
of buffers received in input frames and in output frames. The formula to
compute the number of “buffered” buffers in a node is simply: #buffered
= #alloc + #input - #free - #output Note: monitoring will impact
performances.

Basic usage
-----------

1. Turn buffer traces on:

::

   ~# vppctl set buffer traces on

2. Monitor buffer usage:

::

   ~# vppctl show buffer traces verbose

3. Turn buffer traces off:

::

   ~# vppctl set buffer traces off
