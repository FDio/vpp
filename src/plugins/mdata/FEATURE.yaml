              Buffer Metadata Change Tracker
              Uses the before / after graph node main loop performance
              callback hooks to snapshoot buffer metadata, then
              compare and summarize results per-node.
              Answers the question "what buffer metadata does a particular
              graph node change?" by direct observation.
              Zero performance impact until enabled.
