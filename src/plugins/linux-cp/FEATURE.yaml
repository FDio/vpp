        These plugins provide an integration with the Linux network stack.

        The "linux_cp" plugin provides the capability to 'mirror' VPP interfaces
        in the Linux kernel. This means that for any interface in VPP the user
        can create a corresponding TAP or TUN device in the Linux kernel
        and have VPP plumb them together.
        The plumbing mechanics is different in each direction.
        In the RX direction, all packets received on a given VPP interface
        that are punted (i.e. are not dropped or forwarded) are transmitted
        on its mirror interface (this includes for example ARP, ND etc,
        so the recommendation is to disable ARP, ND, ping plugin).
        In the TX direction, packets received by VPP an the mirror Tap/Tun
        are cross-connected to the VPP interfaces. For IP packets, IP output
        features are applied.
        The "linux_nl" plugin listens to netlink messages and synchronizes the IP
        configuration of the paired interfaces.
