        This plugin provides the beginnings of an integration with the
        linux network stack.
        The plugin provides the capability to 'mirror' VPP interfaces in
        the linux kernel. This means that for any interface in VPP the user
        can create a correcsponding TAP or TUN device in the linux kernel
        and have VPP plumb them together.
        The plumbing mecahnics is different in each direction.
        In the RX direction, all packets received on a given VPP interface
        that are punted (i.e. are not droped or forwarded) are transmitted
        on its mirror interface (this includes for example ARP, ND etc,
        so the recommendation is to disabe ARP, ND, ping plugin).
        In the TX direction, packets recevied by VPP an the mirror Tap/Tun
        are cross-connected to the VPP interfaces. For IP packets, IP output
        features are applied.
        This is the begginnings of integration, because there needs to be
        an external agent that will configure (and synchronise) the IP
        configuration of the paried interfaces.
