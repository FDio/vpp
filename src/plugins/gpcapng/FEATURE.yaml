        Generic PCAPNG (GPCAPNG) plugin provides high-performance packet
        capture capabilities.
        It implements a pluggable filter architecture that allows for
        extensible packet filtering implementations, tailored for
        a specific use case. Captured packets are written in PCAPNG format
        and can be directed to multiple destinations including local files and HTTP endpoints.
