name: ACL Based Forwarding
maintainer: Neale Ranns <neale@graphiant.com>
features:
  - 'Policy Based Routing'
  - ACLs identify how traffic should be forwarded. Packets matching a permit
    rule are forwarded using ABF policy. Packets matching a deny rule are
    excluded from ABF handling and continue traversing the input feature arc on
    the L3 path.
  - Each rule in the ACL has an associated 'path' which determines how the
    traffic will be forwarded. This path is described as a FIB path, so anything
    possible with basic L3 forwarding is possible with ABF (with the exception
    of output MPLS labels)
  - ACLs are grouped into a policy
  - ACL priorities within the policy determine which traffic is preferentially
    matched
  - Policies are attached to interfaces.
  - ABF runs as an input feature in the L3 path
