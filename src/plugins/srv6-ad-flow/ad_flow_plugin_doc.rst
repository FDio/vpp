SRv6 per-flow dynamic proxy
===========================

This document describes SRv6 endpoint to SR-unaware appliance via
per-flow dynamic proxy

Overview
--------

TBD

CLI configuration
-----------------

The following command instantiates a new End.AD.Flow segment that sends
the inner packets on interface ``IFACE-OUT`` towards an appliance at
address ``S-ADDR`` and restores the encapsulation headers of the packets
coming back on interface ``IFACE-IN``.

::

   sr localsid address SID behavior end.ad.flow nh S-ADDR oif IFACE-OUT iif IFACE-IN

For example, the below command configures the SID ``1::A1`` with an
End.AD.Flow function for sending traffic on interface
``GigabitEthernet0/8/0`` to the appliance at address ``A1::``, and
receiving it back on interface ``GigabitEthernet0/9/0``.

::

   sr localsid address 1::A1 behavior end.ad.flow nh A1:: oif GigabitEthernet0/8/0 iif GigabitEthernet0/9/0
