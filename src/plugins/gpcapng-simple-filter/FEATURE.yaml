description: |-
        GPCAPNG Simple Filter provides the default filter implementation
        for the Generic PCAPNG plugin. It supports comprehensive GENEVE
        packet filtering including 5-tuple matching for both outer and
        inner headers, as well as GENEVE option-based filtering with
        flexible data matching capabilities. The filter implementation
        uses VPP's multi-architecture compilation system to provide
        per-platform variants for different CPU architectures, automatically
        selected at runtime. However, the lookup is intentionally kept very simple,
        so may not provide maximum possible performance.
