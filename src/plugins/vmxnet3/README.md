# VMWARE vmxnet3 device driver plugin

##Overview
This plugin provides native PCI driver support for VMWare vmxnet3.

##Prerequisites
 * This code is tested with vfio-pci driver installed with Ubuntu 18.04 which
has kernel version 4.15.0-33-generic.

 * This code is tested with ESXi vSwitch version 6.0, release build 3620759.

 * Driver requires MSI-X interrupt support, which is not supported by
uio_pci_generic driver, so vfio-pci needs to be used. On systems without IOMMU
vfio driver can still be used with recent kernels which support no-iommu mode.

##Known issues

* NUMA support
* TSO/LRO
* RSS/multiple queues
* VLAN filter

## Usage
### System setup

1. load VFIO driver
```
sudo modprobe vfio-pci
```

2. (systems without IOMMU only) enable unsafe NOIOMMU mode
```
echo Y | sudo tee /sys/module/vfio/parameters/enable_unsafe_noiommu_mode
```

3. Bind interface to vfio-pci
```
sudo dpdk-devbind.py --bind vfio-pci 0b:00.0
```

### Interface Creation
Interface can be dynamically created with following CLI:
```
create interface vmxnet3 0000:0b:00.0
set int state vmxnet3-0/b/0/0 up
```

### Interface Deletion
Interface can be deleted with following CLI:
```
delete interface vmxnet3 <if-name>
```

### Interface Statistics
Interface statistics can be displayed with `show hardware-interface <if-name>`
command.

### Show Interface CLI
Interface and ring information can be obtained with
`show vmxnet3 [if-name] [desc]`
