        GPCAPNG Show Packets provides PCAPNG file analysis capabilities
        for captured GENEVE traffic. It can read and parse PCAPNG files,
        displaying detailed information about captured packets including
        some protocol stack breakdown from Ethernet through GENEVE to
        inner protocols. The plugin provides interactive CLI commands
        for browsing captured packets with support for limiting output
        and verbose display modes. It is intended for the use during
        development/testing.
