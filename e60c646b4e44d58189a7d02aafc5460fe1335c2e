      "message": "Hi Neale,\n\nThe cryptodev engine was designed in a way when line 498 check passes all ops in the frame shall be enqueued in full, hence the mempool_put of unenqueued ops are not needed. Was it because the device you are working having different behavior?\n\nP.S. I have submitted the patch https://gerrit.fd.io/r/c/vpp/+/31703 to use adaptive cryptodev data path depends on the device capability, could you have a look?\n\nRegards,\nFan",
