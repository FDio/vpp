      "message": "Hi Zach,\n\nIn short in the latest patch all flows can be added to fast path. I believe it is better Piotr to explain the details. He is on holiday and will be back next Monday.\n\nBefore the change we thought of adding a new API to check if fast path is enabled for a policy - apparently after the change it is not needed anymore. Do you still think it is necessary?\n\nRegards,\nFan",
