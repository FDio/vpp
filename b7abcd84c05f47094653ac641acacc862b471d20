      "message": "Hello Matthew,\nCould you help me with my issue described in [0]? There\u0027s 2 issues right now with lcp + ipv6 enabled on the host:\n1. we rely on getting netlink messages to assign/remove ipv6 on the interface but don\u0027t respect interface removal (in this case we don\u0027t receive a message until the tap interface is removed. it might be that we won\u0027t receive RTM_DELLINK for ipv6 at all, but I haven\u0027t checked TBH). \n\nTherefore, we might get DELETED entries in ipv6 mfib.\n\n2. On VRF creation we lock and assign some settings for a given table and on removal we hit the assertion ROUTES_NUM \u003d\u003d 0. this one is not that crucial IMO except that it breaks some usecases like mine: e.g. running regression testing in debug mode.\n\nI wanted to ask your opinion on suggested ways to \"fix\" it (if it should be fixed in your opinion).\n\nThanks, \nStan \n\n[0] https://lists.fd.io/g/vpp-dev/topic/linux_cp_ip6_ll_cleanup/108819740",
