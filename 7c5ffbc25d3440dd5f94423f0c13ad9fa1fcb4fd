I guess this is just a limitation of interfaces in vpp. But even we think about solving this generally, I guess our only option is to select network topologies from tests dynamically. Not sure we want to go there ..\n\nBut on a different note, any reason why we shouldn\u0027t just configure 2 queues (or more) + consistent_qp always, even for single threaded tests?",
