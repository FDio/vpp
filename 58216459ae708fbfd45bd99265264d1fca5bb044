      "message": "Thanks for contributing this, but I think it\u0027s obsolete now. A similar patch which was already merged makes the same sort of change (https://gerrit.fd.io/r/c/vpp/+/44878).\n\nThe other patch had an additional check which would cause the (host_index, lipi) mapping to be stored if ns and lcp_get_default_ns() are both null (this would happen when you are adding your linux-cp taps to the host system\u0027s default netns). Thats the reason the other one was merged instead of this one.",
