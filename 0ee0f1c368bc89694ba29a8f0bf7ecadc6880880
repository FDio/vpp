      "message": "I think hash_set_mem_alloc may not suitable for hash that uses string as key, since the allocation inside the hash_set_mem_alloc is always allocating a fixed size of bytes, while the policer name (string) is not fixed in length.\n\nthe idea of the changes I did is actually similar to the function hash_unset_mem_free.\nhowever the hash.h didn\u0027t provide something like \"hash_unset_mem_free_vec\" thus I free the vec in that way.\n\nanother approach I can think of is to store the string address into the policer (making use of the pad64), but this way will change the data structure of policer_read_response_type_st",
