      "message": "Hmm, not sure about this. You *can* use the worker track for logging these events but I think it may be more useful if you have some other context, like an acl session. That would enable you to do per-session, fine grained, event tracking as opposed to per worker, i.e., bunch of sessions.",

(also, at least this debug code is primarily worker-context-focused, rather than session-focused), to debug the interactions between the main thread and the worker threads..",
