      "message": "I believe each interface loopN would have its own instance of loopN-tx node.  All packets in the frame should have the same sw_if_index for TX so we can just read it from the first packet and then use it for all sub-subsequent packets. The checks for sw_if_index being the same among packets should not be required. The checks for sw_if_index being in a bridge is needed once only.",
