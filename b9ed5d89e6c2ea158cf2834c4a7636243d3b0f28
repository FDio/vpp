      "message": "When this code is actually getting executed in the main thread, the state and condition of the bond interface might have changed such that link up/link down event might not be valid anymore. I think we should pass the sw_if_index and event to this function. When this function is run, grab the bif from the sw_if_index. Based on the event link up/down, test the condition again prior to calling vnet_hw_interface_set_flags so that we don\u0027t erroneously set the flags to the wrong state.",
