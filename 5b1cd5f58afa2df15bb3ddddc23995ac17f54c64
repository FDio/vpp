      "message": "This logic is wrong I think: the GSO may be enabled on ingress interface and disabled on this one. This logic will cause a failure then-- you will not be able to segment the GSO frame if it is there. So you always need to call the tx function with \"do_gso \u003d 1\" here, unless you have other way to know whether there are gso frames that you might need to segment. Am I understanding it all right ?",

You enable GSO on intf1 *only*, get GSO packet which gets forwarded to intf2, where this logic forwards it into datapath that can not segment it, what happens with that packet then ? \"do_gso\" in this case meant (at least in the original code) \"compile-in the logic to segment the GSO packets if needs to\".",
