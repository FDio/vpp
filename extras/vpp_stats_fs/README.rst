VPP stats segment FUSE filesystem
=================================

The statfs binary allows to create a FUSE filesystem to expose and to
browse the stats segment. It relies on the Go-FUSE library and requires
Go-VPP stats bindings to work.

The binary mounts a filesystem on the local machine with the data from
the stats segments. The counters can be opened and read as files
(e.g.Â in a Unix shell). Note that the value of a counter is determined
when the corresponding file is opened (as for /proc/interrupts).

Directories update their contents on epoch changes so that new counters
get added to the filesystem.

The script ``install.sh`` is responsible for building and installing
the filesystem.

Usage
-----

The local Makefile contains targets for all the possible interactions
with the stats_f binary.

Help
~~~~

A basic help menu

.. code:: bash

   make help

Install
~~~~~~~

Building the binary

.. code:: bash

   make install

Start
~~~~~

Starts the filesystem. Requires a running VPP instance using the default
socket /run/vpp/stats.sock.

May require a privileged user (sudo)

.. code:: bash

   make start

Stop
~~~~

Stops and unmounts the filesystem if it is not busy.

May require a privileged user (sudo)

.. code:: bash

   make stop

Force unmount
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Forces the unmount of the filesystem even if it is busy.

May require a privileged user (sudo)

.. code:: bash

   make force-unmount

Cleanup
~~~~~~~

Cleaning stats_fs binary.

May require a privileged user (sudo).

.. code:: bash

   make clean

Browsing the filesystem
-----------------------

The default mountpoint is /run/vpp/stats_fs_dir. You can browse the
filesystem as a regular user. Example:

.. code:: bash

   cd /run/vpp/stats_fs_dir
   cd sys/node
   ls -al
   cat names

Building and mounting the filesystem manually
---------------------------------------------

For more modularity, you can build and mount the filesystem manually.

Building
~~~~~~~~

Inside the local directory, you can build the go binary:

.. code:: bash

   go build

Mounting
~~~~~~~~

Then, you can mount the filesystem with the local binary.

May require a privileged user (sudo).

The basic usage is:

.. code:: bash

   ./stats_fs <MOUNT_POINT>

**Options:** - debug <true|false> (default is false) - socket
<statSocket> (default is /run/vpp/stats.sock) : VPP socket for stats

Unmounting the file system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can unmount the filesystem with the fusermount command.

May require a privileged user (sudo)

.. code:: bash

   fusermount -u /path/to/mountpoint

To force the unmount even if the resource is busy, add the -z option:

.. code:: bash

   fusermount -uz /path/to/mountpoint
