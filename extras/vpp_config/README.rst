Summary:

The purpose of the VPP configuration utility is to allow the user to configure
VPP in a simple and safe manner. The utility takes input from the user and
then modifies the key configuration files. The user can then examine these files
to be sure they are correct and then actually apply the configuration. The user
can also install a released and stable version of VPP. This is currently
released with release 17.10.

Use:

The installation and executing of the VPP configuration utility is simple. First
install the python pip module. Using pip install, then pip install vpp-config.
Then simply type “vpp-config” and answer the questions. If you are not sure what
to answer choose the default. For yes or no questions the capital letter
designates the default. For example, for a question that shows [Y/n] Y is the
default. For numbers the default is within the brackets for example for a
question that shows [1024]. 1024 is the default. 

The flow of the utility is to inspect the system, if VPP is not install it,
create dry run configurations, inspect the files created during the dry run,
apply the configuration and then inspect the system again and then repeat.  

Caveats:

- Supports Ubuntu, centos7, RedHat is coming shortly.

For Developers:

Modifying the code is reasonable simple. The process would be edit and debug the
code from the root directory. In order to do this, we need a script that will copy
or data files to the proper place. This is where they end up with pip install. For
Ubuntu, this is /usr/local/vpp/vpp-config. I have provided a script that will copy
the relevant files correctly. I have also provided a script that will clean the
environment so you can start from scratch. These are the steps to run the utility
in this environment. The scripts are meant to be run from the root directory.

  ./scripts/clean.sh
  ./scripts/cp-data.sh 
  ./vpp_config.py 

When the utility is installed with pip the wrapper scripts/vpp-config is written to
/usr/local/bin. However, the starting point when debugging this script locally is
./vpp_config.py. Run the utility by executing ./vpp_config.py from the root directory. 

The start point in the code is in vpp_config.py. However, most of the work is done in
the files in ./vpplib

Uploading to PyPi:

To upload this utility to PpPi simple do the following. Currently, I have my own account
when we want everyone to contribute we will need to change that.

  sudo –H bash
  cd vpp_config
  python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
  twine upload dist/*

Example Run:

# pip install vpp-config
# vpp-config

Welcome to the VPP system configuration utility

These are the files we will modify:
    /etc/vpp/startup.conf
    /etc/sysctl.d/80-vpp.conf
    /etc/default/grub

Before we change them, we'll create working copies in /usr/local/vpp/vpp-config/dryrun
Please inspect them carefully before applying the actual configuration (option 3)!
