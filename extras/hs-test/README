Host stack test framework
-------------------------

For building docker image run `make` first and `./test` to run all the tests.
`./test` script is basically a wrapper for `go test` and accepts its parameters,
for example following runs a specific test: `./test -run Veth/EchoBuilt`.

Root privileges is required to run tests as it uses linux `ip` command for
configuring topology.
