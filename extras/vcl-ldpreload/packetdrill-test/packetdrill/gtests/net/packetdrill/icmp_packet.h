/* Create and initialize a new struct packet containing an ICMP
 * packet. The 'type_string' identifies the ICMP type. The
 * 'code_string' identifies the ICMP code (and NULL means no code was
 * provided, in which case we assume a default code of 0).
 * The 'protocol' is either IPPROTO_UDP or IPPROTO_TCP.
 * The 'tcp_start_sequence' and 'payload_bytes' describe the TCP or UDP
 * packet echoed inside the ICMP message. The 'mtu' specifies the MTU
 * advertised in "packet is too big" ICMP message, or -1 for no
 * MTU. On success, returns a newly-allocated packet. On failure,
 * returns NULL and fills in *error with an error message.
