# packetdrill
This is the official Google release of packetdrill.

The packetdrill scripting tool enables quick, precise tests for entire TCP/UDP/IPv4/IPv6 network stacks, from the system call layer down to the NIC hardware. packetdrill currently works on Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD. It can test network stack behavior over physical NICs on a LAN, or on a single machine using a tun virtual network device.

The code is GPLv2. Currently the source for the testing tool and a number of test scripts is in the git repository. We will continue to post more tests from our team's Linux TCP test suite (described in our USENIX paper), as time permits.
