# This file contains the commit IDs from master that the cherry-pick
# analysis tooling should ignore.
#
# This can be the following classes of commits:
#
# 1) the commits that are known to have been cherry-picked but
#    for some reason the tooling can not detect that
#    (e.g. if someone does a cp file-in-master file-in-stable1908)
# 2) the commits that are known to not be acceptable for
#    cherry-picking due to them changing other important external
#    contracts from VPP to the user, e.g. socket paths,
# 3) any commit that we explicitly want to
#    not even show in the tooling for cherrypicking,
#    for whatever reason
#
# changes the path of the API socket
