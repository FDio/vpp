meta-vpp
========

This Yocto Project layer provides support for building **Vector Packet Processing (VPP)** — the high-performance data plane from FD.io — in embedded Linux systems.

It enables seamless integration of VPP with DPDK acceleration, systemd service management, and Python API bindings into custom Yocto-based images.

The `extras/oe/` directory contains the reference build configuration for OpenEmbedded/Yocto.  
All active development, branch-specific recipes, and maintenance are hosted upstream at:  
https://github.com/skbuff-ru/meta-vpp

Please use the upstream repository for the latest stable releases and OE branch support.
