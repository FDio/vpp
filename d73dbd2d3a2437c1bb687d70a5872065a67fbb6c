One for pip (and related stuff, such as setuptools), the other one for the rest.\n\nBut this Change moves in the right direction.",

      "message": "Thanks!\n\nYes. There are 2 invocations of pip install, if you want to look at it that way.  Once from the packages installed via the make install-deps, or by calling virtualenv.  That can be used to then do \npython -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt if we need a specific pip version.  We control the initial version and can control the final version as well.\n\nAnother nice side effect is that it shortens build time/bandwidth requirements and tests can be run without having to be online. ;)",
