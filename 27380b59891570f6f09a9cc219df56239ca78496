The code segment claims if current compiler support compiler option \"-march\u003darmv8.2-a+crc+crypto+lse\", then the target binary will be compiled for OcteonTX2, and some OcteonTX2 features will be applied. This is not true.\nThere will be other Arm CPUs which is armv8.2 and supports crc/crypto/lse features, but NOT OcteonTX2.",

      "message": "Hi Lijian, \nThanks for the comment.\n\n\u003e\u003eThere will be other Arm CPUs which is armv8.2 and supports crc/crypto/lse features, but NOT OcteonTX2.\nThis is specific to octeontx2 and does not conflict with any other chip. Generic ARM chip that supports armv8.2+crc+crypto+lse can add extra multi-arch function and compile option which will not conflict with Octeontx2. Implementerid and part number check at runtime handles multi-arch select. Moreover there is a multi-arch priority feature that can also be used to select higher priority function.\n\nWe specifically need multi-arch support for our chip specific features to make it work with binary comes with distros. In this case I tried enabling HW mempool_ops",
