      "message": "Hi Xiaoming. The patch, as is, is a bit too invasive. I understand the issue you\u0027re describing, but the expectation is that session cleanups are slow enough to allow for io events to drain. Control events should not be a problem as we always drain them on dispatch. \n\nCould you provide a bit more details about the crash you\u0027re hitting. Given your previous usage, I suspect you\u0027re using udp so I\u0027m guessing udp connection cleanup is too fast? Are we running into a situation where udp is scheduled for tx but there\u0027s not data in the tx fifo?",
