      "message": "While this is not part of this change set, this variable definition is missing the \"extern\" prefix to make this a variable declaration instead of a definition.  This header file is included in lots of .c files and there will be multiple allocations of storage for this symbol in each of them.  It is also similarly defined in .../vlib/vlib/main.h without the \"extern\" prefix.",
