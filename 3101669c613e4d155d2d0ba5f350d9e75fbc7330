      "message": "I don\u0027t believe the salt is actually used in non-AEAD algorithms. For the AEAD algorithms (GCM, CTR) the salt is used to form a nonce, and needs to be known by both sender and receiver so I don\u0027t think its every appropriate for it to be randomly initialized (at the raw ipsec layer at least).",
