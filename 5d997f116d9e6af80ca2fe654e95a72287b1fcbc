      "message": "this is confusing. all of these functions are available in header and one needs to dive into code to see what is the real difference between\n\nadd_del(is_add\u003d\u003cappropriate value\u003e) and _add/_del themselves.\n\nI see that add_del has a common part and then calls either _add or _del.\n\nSo I would propose one of two solutions - I myself would prefer #1:\n\n1.) extract the common part of add_del and call it say nat44_ed_handle_resolve_records and make _add and _del functions call this common code at beginning of each function\n\n-or-\n\n2.) rename _add/_del to _add_internal/_del_internal and make them static, only used by add_del and not advertised in header(s)\n\nI\u0027m not a huge fan of various is_ switches in functions calls hence my preference for #1",

      "message": "_add/_del are internaly used by resolve logic - when interface receives ip address (dhcp/user configuration) the _add is called the same applies when address is removed. there also multiple internal cases where the resolve record logic isn\u0027t required. i will use your suggestion from 1 but add internal static _add/_del.",
