MCBU tentatively merges 4 private patches into MCBU\u0027s VPP branch (for CUSP build).\n  2. MCBU builds CUSP upon this VPP branch (which is patched by 4 private patches).\n  3. MCBU provides the tentative CUSP library to OWM.\n  4. OWM syncs OWM\u0027s VPP sources to MCBU\u0027s branch (for CUSP build).\n  5. OWM builds CUSP-proxy upon the sync\u0027d VPP branch and the tentative CUSP library.\n  6. OWM provides the tentative CUSP-proxy to MCBU.\n  7. Each of MCBU and OWM can test the tentative application (CUSP + CUSP-proxy).\n\nIs my view same as yours?",
