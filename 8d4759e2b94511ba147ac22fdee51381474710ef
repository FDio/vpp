      "message": "I looked into the test failure - seems the wireguard tests are flaky... so this change does not make any tests fail. Also, thinking of what you wrote Steven - if the ei is null, then the dereference of it here would cause a crash - which does not happen, therefore this seems like a legit way to tackle this ? I am also adding Matt whose name pops up in \"git blame\" on this code, hoping he might have an opinion as well. :-)",

When ei is null (local interface), do we want to check the dmac for that case? Notice after your change\nif ( !(ei \u0026\u0026 ...) ) is true if ei is null",
