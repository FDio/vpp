# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_CHECK_JAVA_PLUGIN(<shell-variable>)
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   This macro sets <shell-variable> to empty on failure and to a compatible
#   version of plugin.jar otherwise. Directories searched are /usr/java/*
#   and /usr/local/java/*, which are assumed to be j{dk,re} installations.
#   Apply the shell variable as you see fit. If sun changes things so
#   <jre>/lib/plugin.jar is not the magic file it will stop working.
#
#   This macro assumes that unzip, zipinfo or pkzipc is available (and can
#   list the contents of the jar archive). The first two are assumed to work
#   similarly enough to the infozip versisonms. The pkzipc version is
#   assumed to work if I undertstand the documentation on pkware's site but
#   YMMV. I do not have access to pwkware's version to test it.
