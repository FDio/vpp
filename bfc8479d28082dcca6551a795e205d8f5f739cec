Is that something like release notes?\n\n2\u003e Regarding the issue, I didn\u0027t start to debug. what I currently have known is: The LDP\u0027s APP Nginx tries to respond but the packages were blocked while the peer is waiting for them.  if turn back and check the VPP\u0027s status I found:\u0027udp4-output Invalid connection error\u0027. so, it looks like the UDP added a new egress Node. I am not sure of that now.\n\n3\u003e Because this issue is found on the master branch after stable/2210 and is irrelevant to these tickets, can we open a new ticket or some else to discuss this? I want to close these tickets.",
