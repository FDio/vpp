      "message": "Could the last 2 bytes be set to 0 by ethernet_set_mac() instead of having to mask them off here (and below for the secondary addresses)? Previously MAC addresses were being stored in 6 byte data structures so when we retrieved them by casting to a u64 *, we had to mask off the last 2 bytes. Since an ethernet_interface_address_t now has 8 bytes, it seems like those last 2 bytes could be zeroed when the address is stored and these operations which mask those bytes off could be eliminated.",
