      "message": "If understand correctly, currently, `wmp-\u003emax_handshake_cookie` represents the rate the server can generate cookie messages as this branch is only executed when a cookie was replied. And looking at the updated version of `wg_if_is_under_load()`, `wmp-\u003emax_handshake_cookie` is used there as if it was the rate the server can process handshake messages. The latter seems to be correct for me.\n\nCan you clarify what the intension of `wmp-\u003emax_handshake_cookie` is?",
