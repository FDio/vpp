      "message": "If understand correctly, currently, `wmp-\u003emax_handshake_cookie` represents the rate the server can generate cookie messages as this branch is only executed when a cookie was replied. And looking at the updated version of `wg_if_is_under_load()`, `wmp-\u003emax_handshake_cookie` is used there as if it was the rate the server can process handshake messages. The latter seems to be correct for me.\n\nCan you clarify what the intension of `wmp-\u003emax_handshake_cookie` is?",

      "message": "So what you are saying is that some another rate, and not handshake messages processing rate,  is used to determine how many handshake messages the server can process in a certain time intrerval. That does not sound correct to me.\n\nCan you clarify why it is needed to artificially overestimate the rate the server is able to process handshake messages? And what are the reasons the actual handshake messages processing rate is not used?",
