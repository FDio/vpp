I always found it a bit ugly doing all the time struct_t s; memset(\u0026s, 0, sizeof()); then init the fields; and then pass it to the function.\nI can see some benefits of it, but also drawbacks.\nAs a bonus, the new design also supports default arguments! :-) (not that we really need that, but I find it cool that we can do it in C)",
