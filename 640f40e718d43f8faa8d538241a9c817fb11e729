Otherwise, we are already returning the error at the end.\n\nNote that we are already generating partial enqueue errors, if the segment is larger than the space we have in the fifo. There\u0027s nothing \u0027special\u0027 in that sense about failure to grow. Having said that, growth errors should not be common. Or at least that\u0027s the job of the fifo tuning logic.",
