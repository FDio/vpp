I\u0027m not a fan of hard-coded configuration conventions.\n\nIMHO, the code at this level be enforcing session layer conventions, so it is not clear to me why the asserts are here.  Or am I misunderstanding what the assert is meant to guard against (e.g. a rogue session udp callback)?\n\nMaybe it is just old debug code and can be discarded...",
