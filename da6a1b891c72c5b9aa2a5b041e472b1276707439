I considered changing that, but even if we were defaulting to 2-tuple for fragments you still end up with fragmented and non-fragmented packets taking different paths.\nSo if you want consistent path in face of fragmentation, you must configure to 3-tuple flow-hash altogether.",

Anyway, I do not have a strong opinion, but I do agree we want v4 and v6 behaving the same way. So I\u0027ll follow what is decided for v4 :)",
