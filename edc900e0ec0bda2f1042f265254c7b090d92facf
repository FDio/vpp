      "message": "Auto-selection of IDs seems like it might cause problems in the opposite direction of the one you\u0027re solving here. You might attempt to create a tap with a given instance/ID number and find that you can\u0027t because that ID was used by a tap the was implicitly created for use with a linux-cp pair.\n\nE.g. if you have a management system that maintains a persistent DB of configurations and applies them to VPP, you might have taps 0,1,2 allocated implicitly when pairs are created for 3 physical NICs. Then you might explicitly configure tap 3 for some purpose. Then you add some tunnel, bond, and loopback interfaces and create pairs for those and taps 4,5,6 are allocated. If you restart/reboot and configurations are applied from the persistent DB in a different order than when they were configured interactively, you might have the tunnel, bond, and loopback interfaces created and have pairs allocated for them before the tap is created and when the system attempts to create the explicitly configured tap, the ID 3 will be in use already by the tap created for one of those pairs.\n\nIt would be more deterministic to select an ID for tap being created for a pair by adding the hw_if_index to some large offset (e.g. \u0027.id \u003d 99000 + hw-\u003ehw_if_index,\u0027). Then the linux-cp taps are allocated from some predictable range and you can safely use the lower ID values that people are more likely to use (0, 1, 10, 100, etc) when explicitly creating taps without worrying about conflict.",

      "message": "Hello Matthew,\n\nThanks for the detailed response. \n\nMy point was mainly in that the \"lcp create\" shouldn\u0027t fail. I have a control plane which allocated tap interfaces based on their names, not on their instance ids\u0027. Because if user/control plane creates a loopback with a \"wrong\" id - the lcp won\u0027t be able to create a lcp pair for that device anymore, which is not 100% correct in my opiniion.\n\nI come up with a hybrid scheme: tap interfaces are allocated from 10000 + hw_id + next slot if this was taken. Let me know if that works for you, if not, I\u0027ll be still happy to merge just a plain offset version (without auto-selecting the next available slot).",
