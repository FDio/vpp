      "message": "Can the user precisely see the number of established and transitory sessions that are still active? As far as I understand, these numbers are polluted by the already timed out sessions and there is no way for the user to tell them apart.\nI am wondering if this is a problem also for ICMP and UDP, from the numbers, we do not know how many ICMP or UDP sessions are still \"active\". Did I overlook something?\nI would suggest to continue the loop after the `if (now \u003e\u003d sess_timeout_time)` check.",

      "message": "What is the reason of not updating last_heard by an RST?\nSuppose the session is established and there was no packet received for 10 mins. Then an RST is forwarded and the state is set to RST_TRANS. The transitory timeout is immediately over in this case because `s-\u003elast_heard + nat44_session_get_timeout (s)` is already in the past.\n\nAnd it seems to me that the other 3 states below could have the same problem.\nWe could see if this is a real issue with a test case.",
