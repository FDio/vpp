      "message": "I think part of the issue with this patch is it looks a bit ad-hoc, and we\u0027d rather not have various parts of stat segment creeping up in API over time.\n\nAt the same time, I agree there is a real usecase here:\n- make sure the control plane can read up-to-date and not 10s old data\n- read a few values out of the stat segment without having to pull the whole stat segment dependencies\n\nSo what about this:\n- an API to force stat segment synchronization (basically an API which would just force the stat segment thread callback to execute before returning). Kind of a memory barrier, but for stat segment\n- another API to query any stat segment counter per path",
