      "message": "things like \"ptd-\u003ecrypto_key_data\" should dissapear from crypto engines.\n\n1. on init crypto engine tells crypto infra for each op type how much memory it needs for key_data, also it needs to say how much it needs for per-thread key_data and expected alignment for both\n\n2. on key add crypto_key_t should be allocated so it have space for both key and key_data\n\n3 on encrypt/decrypt crypto infra passes pointer to key_data so crypto_engine doesn\u0027t need to have any internal data allocated\n\nAt the end we need to remove any vlib/vppinfra includes (so no vectors, pools, ...) from crypto_engines so we can have stable ABI for FIPS compliance",
