      "message": "Your change would make this check to set bvi_flag not \ncorrect. I wonder if there is another way we can use to \ncheck if loopback is used as a BVI or not.  One way is \nto check if it is in a BD using sw_if_index.  I suppose \nwe can and get sw_if_index outside of the while loop \nfrom the first packet in the first frame since it should \nnot change anyway. Once we have the sw_if_index, it \nwould be something like:\n  config \u003d l2input_intf_config (sw_if_index);\n  bvi_flag \u003d (config-\u003ebridge);\nThe down side would be, what if someone put a loopback \ninto a BD without making it a BVI. I don\u0027t know how \nloopback can be used in BD in non-BVI mode anyway, so it \nwould be a moot point.",
