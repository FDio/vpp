      "message": "I agree, but I was using a small script and \u0027vppctl exec\u0027 to create and a then a separate to delete. On the first run /tmp/vhost1.sock was associated with VirtualEthernet0/0/0, and on the second run it was associated with VirtualEthernet0/0/3. But vhost1.sock is hard coded in my libvirt XML. Anyway, makes it hard to automate so I was trying to document the behavior. The \u0027renumber\u0027 behavior was a little unstable, but the right answer may be to fix it.\n\nWould you be opposed to leaving in place for now and I fix the \u0027renumber\u0027 later and remove the text at that point?",
