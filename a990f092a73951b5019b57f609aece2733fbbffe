It has been long standing task and necessary for virtual device testing.\n\u003e 1) Can you please provide simple example (ping test) how to write down device tests\n\u003e 2) The setup environment requires VM and may be specific kernel image. Will the environment be cleaned after the test completion?\n\n@Mohsin, \n1) I have added a sample test named test_vm_tap.py.\n2) For debian, the script downloads a generic kernel image into the /tmp/vpp-vm-tests directory. This image is cached for further test runs. When you run make test-wipe, everything is cleaned.",
