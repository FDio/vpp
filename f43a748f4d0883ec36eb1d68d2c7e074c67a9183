      "message": "You want to change all of these \u0027clib_unix_warning\u0027 or just this one?\n\nAnd I got a question here:\n\nThe reason I add HW_CACHE eventss is that I expected the L1d load-misses could help us better tuning performance. Unfortuantely it does not. \n\nI can observe the clock cycles difference when I change the code layout of node function by \u0027set pmc cpu-cycles cache-misses\u0027, but, cache-misses show no difference at all. Then I suspect it must be l1 or l2 cache-misses which cause the cycle difference. However, as I can see, l1d-load-misses does not show too much difference. I also tried the processor l2 events, got almost the same result.\n\nAny comments that HW cache events could help somehow?",
