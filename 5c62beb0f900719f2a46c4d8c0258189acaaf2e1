      "message": "We did some tests with bganne, we conclude that \n o tx_prepare in ena driver will cost 10% overhead (for all packets size)\n o when we do need to generate checksum, the hardware offloading will perform efficiently ~25% better even on small packet (64 bytes on the wire)\n \nWe will recommend to use/activate tx_prepare only for ena driver as we are not cpu bounded.\nIf in the future we got issue like ena driver, we could use the tx-prepare flag as workaround.",
