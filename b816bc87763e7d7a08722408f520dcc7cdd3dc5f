      "message": "I think the compiler generates slightly more optimized code if you cache rb_tree_root (rt) to a local variable and uses the local variable throughout this routine instead of using rb_tree_root (rt) repeatedly here. I compile 2 versions and compare. Using the local variable version saves 10 assembly line instructions for debug image. However, I didn\u0027t count the number of CPU cycles actually saved.",
