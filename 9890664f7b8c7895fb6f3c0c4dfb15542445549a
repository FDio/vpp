      "message": "Previously nasm and ipsec-mb were dependecies of dpdk, but it was chnaged when dpdk meson build was enabled. I added ipsec-mb targets to config and install, but I had trouble building ipsec-mb, as nasm biaries installed in install_dir were deleted before ipsec-mb was built. In patch set 4 i also removed the nasm dependency of ipsec-mb and added nasm-config and nasm-install to targets.",
