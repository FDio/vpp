      "message": "Recommended re-wording:\n\nif the github generated tarballs are used, the version information will be missing from the version file (.../src/scripts/.version) which is required by the version script when building in a non-git based workspace or the build will fail.  In that case, put the desired version string into .../src/scripts/.version to satisfy the requirements of the version script.\n\nAlternatively, the ``make dist`` command in a cloned git workspace will generate an xz compressed tarball of the source including the .../src/scripts/.version file containing the git hash using the standard nomenclature for VPP images.\n\nExtract the tarball using the -J option to decompress it using xz. For example,\n``tar xvJf ./build-root/vpp-23.10-rc0~184-g48cd559fb.tar.xz``",
