      "message": "Yes, e-\u003eid is \"Index of start of used descriptor chain\". But we don\u0027t care of chain buffers as vlib_buffer_free will take care of it.\nWe want to use single call vlib_buffer_free to free maximum used buffers at once. So we are checking for consecutive used descriptors, each representing a different packet (either contain a buffer and/or buffers chain).",
