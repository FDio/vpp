      "message": "Thanks for optimizing the pbb vtr check and remove the \"+\" operator. This really should be || and not \u0026\u0026 here, right? With this error, I wonder how would existing output_vtr operation work properly? Is output VTR operation checked by CSIT? If so, why did it pass? \nAnyway, I still don\u0027t like the fact that we now need an extra || operation here when there is no VTR configured. Can we add an extra flag called \"out_vtr_flag\" in l2_output_config_t which would be 0 if no VTR operation and would be 1 if either output_vtr.push_and_pop_bytes is setup or output_pbb_vtr.push_and_pop_bytes is configured. Then this if above just need to check config0-\u003eoutput_btr_flag without needing any other operations.",
